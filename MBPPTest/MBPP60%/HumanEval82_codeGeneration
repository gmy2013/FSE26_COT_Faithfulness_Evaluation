CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the provided chain of thought, here's the complete function:

```python
def sum_Square(n):
    """
    Check if a given integer n can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The integer to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n can be expressed as i² + j² for some integers i, j, False otherwise
    """
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        j = 1
        while j * j <= n:
            if i * i + j * j == n:
                return True
            j = j + 1
        i = i + 1
    return False
```

The function works by iterating through all possible pairs of integers (i, j) where both i² and j² are less than or equal to n, checking if their sum equals n. If such a pair is found, it returns True immediately. If no such pair is found after checking all possibilities, it returns False.
