def max_occurrences(list1):

    for i in list1:

    return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. Initialize `max_val` to 0 to track the highest frequency found.
2. Initialize `result` to the first element of `list1` as a starting candidate.
3. Iterate through each element `i` in `list1`:
   - Calculate the frequency of `i` using `list1.count(i)` and store in `occu`.
   - If `occu` is gre
