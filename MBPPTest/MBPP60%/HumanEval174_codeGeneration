CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def odd_position(nums):
    """Check if all elements are in positions matching their parity.
    
    For each index i, the element at that position should be:
    - Odd if the index is odd
    - Even if the index is even
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements match their index parity, False otherwise
        
    Examples:
        >>> odd_position([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5])
        True
        >>> odd_position([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 4])
        False
        >>> odd_position([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        True
    """
    return all(nums[i] % 2 == i % 2 for i in range(len(nums)))
```

The function correctly implements the described behavior - it verifies that each element at position `i` has the same parity (odd/even) as the index `i` itself.
