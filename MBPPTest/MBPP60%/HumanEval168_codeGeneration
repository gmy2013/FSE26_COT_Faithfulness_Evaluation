CodeGeneration:
The function `Diff` correctly computes the symmetric difference between two lists. Here's the complete function with an improved docstring:

```python
def Diff(li1, li2):
    """
    Compute the symmetric difference between two lists.
    
    The symmetric difference returns elements that are in either li1 or li2,
    but not in both. Duplicates are removed from the result.
    
    Args:
        li1 (list): First input list
        li2 (list): Second input list
        
    Returns:
        list: List containing elements that are in li1 or li2 but not in both
        
    Examples:
        >>> Diff([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])
        [1, 4]
        >>> Diff(['a', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'c', 'd'])
        ['a', 'd']
    """
    return list(set(li1) - set(li2)) + list(set(li2) - set(li1))
```

The function works by:
1. Converting both lists to sets to remove duplicates
2. Finding elements unique to each list using set difference
3. Converting the results back to lists and concatenating them
4. Returning the symmetric difference as a single list
