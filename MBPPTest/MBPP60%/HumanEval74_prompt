def sum_nums(x, y,m,n):
    sum_nums= x + y
    if sum_nums in range(m, n):
        return 20
    else:
        return sum_nums
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `sum_nums` takes four parameters: `x`, `y`, `m`, and `n`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It first computes the sum of `x` and `y`, storing it in the variable `sum_nums`.
3. **Range Check**: It checks if this sum falls within the range `[m, n)` (i.e., from `m` inclusive to `n` exclusive).
4. **Return Logic**:
   - If the sum is in the specified range, it returns `20`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the actual computed sum.
5. **Edge Consideration**: Note that `range(m, n)` in Python includes `m` but excludes `n`, so the condition is `m <= sum_nums < n`.
