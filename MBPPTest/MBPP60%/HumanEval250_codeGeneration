CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with improved implementation:

```python
def Sum_of_Inverse_Divisors(N, Sum):
    """
    Calculate the average of divisors by dividing the sum by the count.
    
    Parameters:
    N (int): The number of divisors
    Sum (int/float): The sum of divisors
    
    Returns:
    float: The average of divisors rounded to 2 decimal places
    """
    if N == 0:
        raise ValueError("N cannot be zero (division by zero)")
    
    ans = float(Sum) / float(N)
    return round(ans, 2)
```

Key improvements made:
- Added proper docstring documentation
- Added error handling for division by zero
- Maintained the original logic of converting to float and rounding
- Improved code readability with proper spacing and comments
