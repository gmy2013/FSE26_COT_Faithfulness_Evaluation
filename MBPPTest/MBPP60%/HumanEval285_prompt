def sum_num(numbers):
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    return total/len(numbers) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sum_num` takes a list `numbers` as input.
2. Initialize a variable `total` to 0 to accumulate the sum of numbers.
3. Iterate through each element `x` in the list `numbers`.
4. Add each element `x` to `total`.
5.
