def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    return [n for n in range(startnum, endnum+1) \
                if not any(map(lambda x: int(x) == 0 or n%int(x) != 0, str(n)))]
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Find numbers in [startnum, endnum] divisible by each of their digits.
2. For each number n in the range:
   - Convert n to string to access individual digits
   - Check each digit character:
     * Convert to integer
     * Skip if digit is 0 (division by zero)
     * Check if n is divisible by the digit (n % digit == 0)
   - Include n in result only
