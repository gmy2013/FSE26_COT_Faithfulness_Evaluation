The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `fifth_Power_Sum(n)` calculates the sum of the fifth powers of all integers from 1 to n.
2. Initialize a variable `sm` to 0 to accumulate the sum.
3. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive).
4. In each iteration, compute the fifth power of the current integer `i` (i.e., i*i
