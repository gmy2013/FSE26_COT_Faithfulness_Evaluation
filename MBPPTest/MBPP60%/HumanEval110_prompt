The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `product_Equal(n)` checks if the product of digits at odd positions equals the product of digits at even positions in the number `n`.
2. For numbers less than 10 (single-digit), it returns `False` immediately since there are no two positions to compare.
3. Initialize `prodOdd` and `prodEven` to 1 to accumulate the products.
4. Process the number digit by digit from right to left (least significant digit first).
5. In each iteration:
   - Extract the rightmost digit (odd position) and multiply it with `prodOdd`.
   - Remove th
