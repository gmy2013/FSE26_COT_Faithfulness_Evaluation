def div_of_nums(nums,m,n):
 result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 and x % n == 0), nums)) 
 return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. Analyze the function name and parameters: `div_of_nums` takes `nums` (a list of numbers), `m`, and `n` (divisors).
2. Understand the goal: Return numbers from `nums` divisible by both `m` and `n`.
3. Review the implementation: Uses `filter` with a lambda checking divisibility by both `m` and `n`, then converts to list.
4. Verify correctne
