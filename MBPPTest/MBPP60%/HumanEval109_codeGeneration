CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def front_and_rear(test_tup):
    """Extract and return the first and last elements of a tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_tup: A tuple from which to extract elements
        
    Returns:
        A tuple containing (first_element, last_element) from the input tuple
        
    Example:
        >>> front_and_rear((1, 2, 3, 4))
        (1, 4)
        >>> front_and_rear(('a', 'b', 'c'))
        ('a', 'c')
    """
    res = (test_tup[0], test_tup[-1])
    return (res)
```

The function implementation is correct and handles the core functionality as described. It uses tuple indexing to access the first element (index 0) and last element (index -1), then returns them as a new tuple.
