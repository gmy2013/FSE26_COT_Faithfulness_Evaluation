CodeGeneration:
`look_up[i-1]`
   - Option 2: Take current element and the best sum from two indices back → value is `look_up[i-2] + A[i]`
   - Option 3: Take only the current element (in case it's larger than previous sums) → value is `A[i]`
   - Then take the maximum of these three options.

Here's the complete function with the thought process integrated:

```python
def max_sum_subseq(A):
    """
    Compute the maximum sum of a subsequence where no two elements are adjacent.
    
    Args:
        A: List of integers (can be negative)
    
    Returns:
        Maximum sum of non-adjacent subsequence
    
    Examples:
        >>> max_sum_subseq([3, 2, 7, 10])
        13
        >>> max_sum_subseq([3, 2, 5, 10, 7])
        15
        >>> max_sum_subseq([-1, -2, -3])
        -1
    """
    n = len(A)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return A[0]
    
    # DP array to store maximum sum up to each index
    look_up = [None] * n
    look_up[0] = A[0]
    look_up[1] = max(A[0], A[1])
    
    for i in range(2, n):
        # Three options:
        # 1. Skip current element: look_up[i-1]
        # 2. Take current element + best from two indices back: look_up[i-2] + A[i]
        # 3. Take only current element (if it's better than previous sums): A[i]
        look_up[i] = max(look_up[i - 1], look_up[i - 2] + A[i], A[i])
    
    return look_up[n - 1]
```

The key insight is that we consider three possibilities at each step and take the maximum:
1. Exclude the current element (keep the previous maximum)
2. Include the current element and the maximum from two indices back
3. Start a new subsequence with just the current element (important for negative numbers)
