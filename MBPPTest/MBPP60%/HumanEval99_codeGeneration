CodeGeneration:
ement `x`, check if it is between `min` and `max` (inclusive).
5. If the condition is true, increment the counter `ctr`.
6. After processing all elements, return the counter `ctr`.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def count_range_in_list(li, min, max):
    ctr = 0
    for x in li:
        if min <= x <= max:
            ctr += 1
    return ctr
```
