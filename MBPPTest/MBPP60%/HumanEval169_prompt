def odd_Num_Sum(n) : 
    j = 0
    sm = 0
    for i in range(1,n + 1) : 
        j = (2*i-1) 
        sm = sm + (j*j*j*j)   
    return sm 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `odd_Num_Sum(n)` calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd numbers.
2. Initialize `j` to 0 (to store each odd number) and `sm` to 0 (to accumulate the sum).
3. Loop `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive) to generate each of the first `n` odd numbers.
4. For each `i`, compute the `i`-th odd number as `j = 2*i - 1`.
