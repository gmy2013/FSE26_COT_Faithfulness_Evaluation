The following is chain of thought:
1. Sort both arrival and departure arrays to process events in chronological order.
2. Initialize platform count (plat_needed) and result to 1 (minimum one platform needed).
3. Use two pointers: i for arrivals (starting at index 1) and j for departures (starting at index 0).
4. Compare current arrival and departure times:
   - If arrival <= departure: need ad
