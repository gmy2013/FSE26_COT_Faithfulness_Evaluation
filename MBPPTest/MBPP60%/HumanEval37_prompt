The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `wind_chill` calculates the wind chill index using the formula provided.
2. The formula combines wind speed `v` and temperature `t` to compute the perceived temperature.
3. The result is computed as: 13.12 + 0.6215*t - 11.37*v^0.16 + 0.3965*t*v^0.16.
4. The computed value is rounde
