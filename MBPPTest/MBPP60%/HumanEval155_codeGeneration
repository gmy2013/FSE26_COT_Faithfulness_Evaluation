CodeGeneration:
the text.
4. If found, it returns 'Found a match!', otherwise 'Not matched!'.

However, the current implementation has a potential issue: the pattern 'ab?' is being used as a string directly in `re.search`. This might not work as intended because without compiling or using raw string, special characters might be interpreted differently, though in this simple case it should work. But to be precise and avoid any issues, we can use a raw string.

Let me adjust the code to use a raw string for the pattern and also add a test case to verify.

Here is the improved code:

```python
import re
def text_match_zero_one(text):
    patterns = r'ab?'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
