def find_Points(l1,r1,l2,r2): 
    x = min(l1,l2) if (l1 != l2) else -1
    y = max(r1,r2) if (r1 != r2) else -1
    return (x,y)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `find_Points` takes four parameters: `l1, r1, l2, r2`.
2. It computes `x` as the minimum of `l1` and `l2` if they are not equal; otherwise, it sets `x` to -1.
3. It computes `y` as the maximum of `r1` and `r2` if they are not equal; otherwise, it sets `y` to -1.
4. It returns a tuple `(x, y)`.
5. The logic is straightforward: if the left endpoints differ, take the smaller
