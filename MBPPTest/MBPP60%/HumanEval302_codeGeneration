CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the provided logic. Here's the corrected and properly formatted Python code:

```python
def count_Unset_Bits(n):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        temp = i
        while temp:
            if temp % 2 == 0:
                cnt += 1
            temp = temp // 2
    return cnt
```

This function counts the number of unset bits (0s) in the binary representations of all numbers from 1 to n. For each number, it processes the bits from least significant to most significant by repeatedly dividing by 2 and checking if the remainder is 0 (indicating an unset bit). The function returns the total count of all unset bits found across all numbers in the range.
