The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for completing the function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function needs to subtract corresponding elements from two nested tuples element-wise
2. **Input Structure**: Both inputs are tuples containing tuples (nested structure)
3. **Operation Required**: For each corresponding inner tuple pair, subtract elements position-wise
4. **Iteration Strategy**: Use nested loops - outer loop iterates through tuple pairs, inner loop iterates through element pairs
5. **Element Access**: Use zip() to pair corresponding inner tuples and corresponding elements within them
6. **Result
