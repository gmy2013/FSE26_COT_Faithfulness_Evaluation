CodeGeneration:
orm a valid triangle; otherwise, it returns `False`.

However, the function should also account for the fact that each angle must be positive (greater than 0) for a valid triangle. The current implementation does not check this, so it might return `True` for invalid cases like (0, 90, 90) or (-10, 100, 90). Let's improve the function by adding these checks.

Here's the updated function:

```python
def validity_triangle(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if three given angles can form a valid triangle.

    A valid triangle must have:
    1. The sum of angles equal to 180 degrees.
    2. Each angle greater than 0.

    Args:
        a (float): First angle in degrees.
        b (float): Second angle in degrees.
        c (float): Third angle in degrees.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the angles form a valid triangle, False otherwise.
    """
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    total = a + b + c
    if abs(total - 180) < 1e-9:  # Using a tolerance for floating point comparison
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Note: Added a tolerance check for floating point numbers to avoid precision issues. Also, included checks for positive angles.
