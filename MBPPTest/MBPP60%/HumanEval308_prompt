The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `previous_palindrome` takes an integer `num` as input.
2. It needs to find the largest palindrome number that is less than `num`.
3. The current implementation iterates from `num-1` down to 1, checking each number.
4. For each number `x`, it converts it to a string and checks if it's equal to its reverse.
5. If a palindrome is found, it returns that number immediately.
6. The range `(num-1, 0, -1)` ensures we start just
