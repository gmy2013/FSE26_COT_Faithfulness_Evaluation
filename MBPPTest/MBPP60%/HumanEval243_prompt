def get_Number(n, k): 
    arr = [0] * n; 
    i = 0; 
    odd = 1; 
    while (odd <= n):   
        arr[i] = odd; 
        i += 1; 
        odd += 2;
    even = 2; 
    while (even <= n): 
        arr[i] = even; 
        i += 1;
        even += 2; 
    return arr[k - 1]; 
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze the function step by step:

1. The function creates an array of length `n`
2. First, it fills the array with odd numbers in increasing order (1, 3, 5...)
3. Then, it fills the remaining positions with even numbers in increasing order (2, 4, 6...)
4. Returns the k-th element (index k-1) from this array

This creates a pattern where all odd numbers come first, followed by all even numbers.

For example, if n=5, the array becomes [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
If n=6, the array becomes [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]

The function essentially returns the k-th number in this specific ordering of numbers from 1 to n.
