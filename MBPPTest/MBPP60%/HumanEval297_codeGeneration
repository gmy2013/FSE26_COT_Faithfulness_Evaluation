CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it's already complete and functional. The implementation correctly follows the docstring description:

```python
from itertools import groupby 

def extract_elements(numbers, n):
    result = [i for i, j in groupby(numbers) if len(list(j)) == n] 
    return result
```

This function:
- Takes a list of numbers and an integer n
- Groups consecutive identical elements using `groupby()`
- For each group, checks if the length equals n
- Returns a list of elements that appear exactly n times consecutively

Example usage:
```python
print(extract_elements([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], 2))  # Returns [1, 4]
print(extract_elements([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], 3))  # Returns [2]
```

The function is already complete and doesn't need any modifications.
