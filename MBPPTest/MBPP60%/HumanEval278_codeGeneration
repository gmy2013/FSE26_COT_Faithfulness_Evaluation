CodeGeneration:
```python
import re
def text_match(text):
    patterns = 'a.*?b$'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return ('Found a match!')
    else:
        return ('Not matched!')
```

The function is already complete and working correctly. It uses the regex pattern `'a.*?b$'` to check if the input text:
- Starts with the letter 'a'
- Contains any characters (matched non-greedily with `.*?`)
- Ends with the letter 'b'

The function returns "Found a match!" if the pattern is found in the text, otherwise "Not matched!".

Example usage:
```python
print(text_match("a quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog b"))  # Found a match!
print(text_match("abc"))  # Not matched! (doesn't end with 'b')
print(text_match("bbb"))  # Not matched! (doesn't start with 'a')
print(text_match("a test b"))  # Found a match!
```
