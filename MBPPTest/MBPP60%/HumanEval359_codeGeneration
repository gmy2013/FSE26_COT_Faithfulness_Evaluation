Based on the analysis, here is an optimized version of the function using memoization to improve efficiency:

```python
def get_noOfways(n, memo=None):
    """
    Calculate the number of ways to reach step n by taking 1 or 2 steps at a time.
    Uses memoization to optimize the recursive Fibonacci calculation.
    
    Args:
        n: The target step number (non-negative integer)
        memo: Dictionary for memoization (internal use)
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of ways to reach step n
    
    Examples:
        >>> get_noOfways(0)
        0
        >>> get_noOfways(1)
        1
        >>> get_noOfways(4)
        3
        >>> get_noOfways(5)
        5
    """
    if memo is None:
        memo = {}
    
    # Check if result is already memoized
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive case with memoization
    result = get_noOfways(n - 1, memo) + get_noOfways(n - 2, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result
```

For even better performance with large inputs, here's an iterative version:

```python
def get_noOfways(n):
    """
    Calculate the number of ways to reach step n by taking 1 or 2 steps at a time.
    Uses iterative approach for optimal performance.
    
    Args:
        n: The target step number (non-negative integer)
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of ways to reach step n
    
    Examples:
        >>> get_noOfways(0)
        0
        >>> get_noOfways(1)
        1
        >>> get_noOfways(4)
        3
        >>> get_noOfways(5)
        5
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize Fibonacci sequence
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b
```

The iterative version has O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it the most efficient solution for large values of n.
