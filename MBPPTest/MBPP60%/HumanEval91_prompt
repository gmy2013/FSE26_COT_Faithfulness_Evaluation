def last_Two_Digits(N): 
    if (N >= 10): 
        return
    fac = 1
    for i in range(1,N + 1): 
        fac = (fac * i) % 100
    return (fac) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function is named `last_Two_Digits` and takes an integer `N` as input.
2. The docstring is missing, but the intended behavior is to compute the last two digits of N! (factorial of N).
3. The current code has a condition: if N >= 10, it returns early (without returning a value). This seems incorrect because we should compute for N >= 10 as well.
4. The logic inside the loop correctly computes factorial modulo 100 to get the last two digits.
5. The issue is the early return condition. It should be removed or corrected.
6. Actually, the condition should be reversed: we should handle cases where N is too small? But for factorial, N=0 or 1 is valid.
7. Alternatively, the condition might be a mistake. Let's check: for N < 10, the factorial might not have two digits? But we still need to return the last two digits (with leading zero if necessary).
8. Actually, the condition is flawed. We should compute for all N >= 0.
9. The correct approach is to remove the conditio
