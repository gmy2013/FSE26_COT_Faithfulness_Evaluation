from itertools import groupby 
def extract_elements(numbers, n):
    result = [i for i, j in groupby(numbers) if len(list(j)) == n] 
    return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `extract_elements` takes two parameters: `numbers` (a list) and `n` (an integer).
2. It uses `itertools.groupby` to group consecutive identical elements in `numbers`.
3. For each group, it checks if the length of the group (number of consecutive occurrences) equals `n`.
4. If the group length matches `n`, the element value is added to the result list.
