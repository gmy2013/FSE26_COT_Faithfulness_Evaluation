5. the function returns "Accept"; otherwise, it returns "Discard".

However, note that the regex pattern `[a-zA-z0-9]$` has a potential issue: `A-z` includes characters between 'Z' and 'a' in the ASCII table (such as '[', '\', ']', '^', '_', '`'), which are not alphanumeric. It should be `[a-zA-Z0-9]$` to correctly match only alphanumeric characters at the end of the string.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import re 
regex = '[a-zA-Z0-9]$'
def check_alphanumeric(string): 
    if(re.search(regex, string)): 
        return ("Accept") 
    else: 
        return ("Discard")
```
