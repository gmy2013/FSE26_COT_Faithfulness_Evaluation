The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the max_sum_of_three_consecutive function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function aims to find the maximum sum of elements where no three consecutive elements are selected. This is a dynamic programming problem with constraints on consecutive selections.

2. **Base Cases Setup**:
   - For n=1: Only one element exists, so sum[0] = arr[0]
   - For n=2: Can select both elements since they're not three consecutive, so sum[1] = arr[0] + arr[1]
   - For n=3: Must avoid selecting all three consecutive elements, so find maximum of:
     - Previous sum (sum[1])
     - Last two elements (arr[1] + arr[2])
     - First and last elements (arr[0] + arr[2])

3. **Dynamic Programming Recurrence**:
   - For i â‰¥ 3, consider three possibilities:
     - Don't include current element: sum[i-1]
     - Include current element but skip previous one: sum[i-2] +
