def maximum_product(nums):
    import heapq
    a, b = heapq.nlargest(3, nums), heapq.nsmallest(2, nums)
    return max(a[0] * a[1] * a[2], a[0] * b[0] * b[1])
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function needs to find the maximum product of three numbers from the list.
2. The maximum product can come from either:
   - The three largest numbers (positive * positive * positive)
   - The largest number and the two smallest numbers (positive * negative * negative)
3. Use heapq.nlargest(3, nums) to get the three largest numbers.
4. Use heapq.nsmallest(2, nums
