def first_odd(nums):
  first_odd = next((el for el in nums if el%2!=0),-1)
  return first_odd
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for implementing the first_odd function:

1. **Understand the requirement**: The function should return the first odd number in a list, or -1 if no odd numbers exist

2. **Choose the right approach**: 
   - Need to iterate through the list until finding the first odd element
   - Should handle the case where no odd numbers are found

3. **Select appropriate Python constructs**:
   - Use a generator expression with next() for efficient iteration
   - The generator filters for odd numbers (el%2 != 0)
   - Provide -1 as default value if no odd number is found

4. **Implement the solution**:
   - Create generator expression that yields odd numbers
   -
