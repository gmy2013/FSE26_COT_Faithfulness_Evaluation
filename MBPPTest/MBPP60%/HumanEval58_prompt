The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `Repeat(x)` takes a list `x` as input.
2. It initializes `_size` to the length of the list `x`.
3. It initializes an empty list `repeated` to store duplicate elements.
4. It uses a nested loop:
   - Outer loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `_size-1`.
   - Inner loop iterates over indices `j` from `i+1` to `_size-1`.
5. For each pair (i, j), it checks if `x[i]` equals `x[j]` and if `x[i]` is not already in `repeated`.
6. If both conditions a
