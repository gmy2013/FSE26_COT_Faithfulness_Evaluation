CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function, I can see it's designed to check if a string starts with the digit "5". However, the current implementation has a limitation - it only checks if the string starts with "5" but doesn't ensure the entire string consists of digits.

Based on the function name `match_num`, it seems like it should verify if the string is a number that starts with 5. Here's an improved version:

```python
import re

def match_num(string):
    """
    Check if the input string is a number that starts with the digit '5'.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The input string to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the string is a number starting with '5', False otherwise
    """
    # Pattern matches: start of string, digit 5, followed by zero or more digits, end of string
    pattern = re.compile(r"^5\d*$")
    return bool(pattern.match(string))
```

Alternative implementation without regex:

```python
def match_num(string):
    """
    Check if the input string is a number that starts with the digit '5'.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The input string to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the string is a number starting with '5', False otherwise
    """
    if not string:  # Handle empty string
        return False
    return string.isdigit() and string.startswith('5')
```

Both versions will:
- Return `True` for strings like "5", "50", "5123"
- Return `False` for strings like "4", "15", "abc", "5a", ""
