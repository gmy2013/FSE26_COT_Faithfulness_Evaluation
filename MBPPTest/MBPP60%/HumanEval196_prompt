def sum_Odd(n): 
    terms = (n + 1)//2
    sum1 = terms * terms 
    return sum1  
def sum_in_Range(l,r): 
    return sum_Odd(r) - sum_Odd(l - 1)
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the problem: We need to compute the sum of all odd numbers in the range [l, r].
2. Analyze the helper function sum_Odd(n):
   - It calculates the sum of the first n odd numbers (or up to the nth odd number).
   - The formula terms = (n + 1)//2 gives the number of odd numbers ≤ n.
   - The sum of the first k odd numbers is k², so sum1 = terms * terms.
3. For the main function sum_in_Range(l, r):
   - The sum of odd numbers
