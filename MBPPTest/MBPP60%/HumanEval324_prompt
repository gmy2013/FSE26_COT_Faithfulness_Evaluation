    for x in temp:
        product *= x
    return product
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `mutiple_tuple` takes a tuple `nums` as input.
2. Convert the tuple to a list to allow iteration (though tuples are also iterable, this conversion is acceptable).
3. Initialize `product` to 1, as multiplying by 1 is the identity operation.
4. Iterate over each element `x` in the list (which was converted from the tuple).
5. M
