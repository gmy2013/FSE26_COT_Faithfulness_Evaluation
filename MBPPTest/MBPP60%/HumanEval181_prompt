The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the Odd_Length_Sum function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function calculates the sum of all elements in odd-length subarrays of the given array.

2. **Key Insight**: For each element at position i, we need to count how many odd-length subarrays include that element.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: 
   - The number of subarrays starting at position j and ending at position k that include element i
   - For element i, the number of starting positions is (i + 1) and ending positions is (l - i)
   - Total subarrays containing element i: (i + 1) Ã— (l
