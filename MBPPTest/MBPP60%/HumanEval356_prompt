The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `get_First_Set_Bit_Pos` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. The expression `n & -n` computes the lowest set bit (LSB) of `n`. This results in a number with only the rightmost set bit of `n` preserved.
3. `math.log2` is applied to the LSB value to determine the exponent (i.e., the position
