import math 
def is_polite(n): 
	n = n + 1
	return (int)(n+(math.log((n + math.log(n, 2)), 2))) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `is_polite(n)` aims to compute the nth polite number.
2. Polite numbers are positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
3. The formula used is based on the known mathematical relationship: the nth polite number is given by \( n + \lfloor \log_2(n + \log_2 n) \rfloor \).
4. The implementation first increments n by 1 because the formula is typically indexed starting from 1 (i.e., for n=1, it returns the first polite number
