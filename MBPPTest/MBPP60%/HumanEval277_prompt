def check_tuples(test_tuple, K):
  res = all(ele in K for ele in test_tuple)
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function checks if all elements in `test_tuple` are present in `K`
2. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `test_tuple`: A tuple whose elements need to be checked
   - `K`: A collection (likely a tuple, list, or set) that serves as the reference for membership checking
3. **Core Logic**: 
   - Uses `all()` function with a generator expression
   - Generator expression iterates through each element in `test_tuple`
   - For each element, checks if it exists in `K` using `in` operator
4. **Return Value**: Returns boolean result from `all()` function
5. **Edg
