The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `is_Product_Even` checks if the product of all elements in the array `arr` is even.
2. The product of numbers is even if at least one number in the product is even.
3. An even number has its least significant bit as 0, so `(number & 1) == 0` checks for evenness.
4. The function iterates through each element in the array up to `n` (the number of elements to consider).
5. If any element is even, it returns `True` immedi
