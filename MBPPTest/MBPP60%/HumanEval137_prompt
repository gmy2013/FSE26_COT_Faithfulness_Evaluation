def geometric_sum(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1 / (pow(2, n)) + geometric_sum(n - 1)
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given geometric_sum function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function aims to compute the geometric series sum S = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(2^n) for a non-negative integer n.

2. **Base Case Identification**: 
   - When n < 0, the function returns 0. This handles negative inputs and serves as the termination condition for the recursion.

3. **Recursive Case Analysis**:
   - For n â‰¥ 0, the function returns 1/(2^n) + geometric_sum(n-1)
   - This recursively builds the sum from the largest term (1/2^n) down to the smallest term (1/2^0 = 1)

4. **Mathematical Verification**:
   - The geometric series sum formula is S = (1 - r^(n+1))/(1-r) where r=1/2
   - For n=0: 1/2^0 = 1 (matches formula: (1-0.5)/0.5 = 1)
   - For n=1: 1 + 1/2 = 1.5 (matches formula: (1-0.25)/0.5 = 1.5)
   - For n=2: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1.75 (matches formula: (1-0.125)/0.5 = 1.75)

5. **Termination Guarantee**:
   - Each recursive call
