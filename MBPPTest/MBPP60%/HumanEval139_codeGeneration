CodeGeneration:
ictionary from these pairs.

However, note that if the tuple has an odd number of elements, the last element will be ignored since it won't form a complete pair.

Let me complete the function with proper formatting and add a docstring for clarity:

```python
def tuple_to_dict(test_tup):
    """
    Convert a tuple to a dictionary by grouping elements into key-value pairs.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): Input tuple containing elements to be converted to dictionary
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary created from consecutive pairs of tuple elements
        
    Example:
        >>> tuple_to_dict(('a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', 3))
        {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    """
    res = dict(test_tup[idx : idx + 2] for idx in range(0, len(test_tup), 2))
    return res
```
