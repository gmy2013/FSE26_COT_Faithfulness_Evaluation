```python
def is_triangleexists(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if three given angles can form a valid triangle.
    
    A valid triangle must satisfy:
    1. All angles must be positive (non-zero)
    2. Sum of all angles must equal 180 degrees
    3. Sum of any two angles must be greater than or equal to the third angle
    
    Args:
        a (float): First angle in degrees
        b (float): Second angle in degrees
        c (float): Third angle in degrees
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the angles can form a valid triangle, False otherwise
    """
    # Check for positive angles
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if sum equals 180 degrees
    if abs(a + b + c - 180) > 1e-10:  # Using tolerance for floating point comparison
        return False
    
    # Check triangle inequality for angles
    if (a + b >= c) and (b + c >= a) and (a + c >= b):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The key improvements made:
1. Changed condition from `!= 0` to `<= 0` to properly handle negative angles
2. Added floating point tolerance for the 180-degree sum check
3. Changed the OR condition to AND condition for triangle inequality (all three conditions must be satisfied, not just one)
4. Added proper docstring with parameter descriptions and return value explanation
5. Used more precise mathematical comparison with tolerance for floating point numbers
