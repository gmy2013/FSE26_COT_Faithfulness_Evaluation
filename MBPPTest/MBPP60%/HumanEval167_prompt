The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `check_Odd_Parity(x)` checks if the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of integer `x` is odd.
2. Initialize `parity` to 0 to count the number of set bits.
3. Use a while loop that continues until `x` becomes 0.
4. Inside the loop, `x = x & (x - 1)` clears the least significant set bit in `x`.
5. Increment `parity` by 1 eac
