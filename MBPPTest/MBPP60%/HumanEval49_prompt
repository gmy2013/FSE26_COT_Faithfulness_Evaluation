The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if the lengths `n` and `m` are equal. If not, return `False` immediately.
2. Sort both arrays `arr1` and `arr2` to bring elements in comparable order.
3. Iterate through indices from `0` to `n-1` (since arrays are of length `n`).
4. Compare elements at each index between the sorted arrays. If any pair differs,
