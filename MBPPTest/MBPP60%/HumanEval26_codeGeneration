CodeGeneration:
ch the right half (mid+1 to end) since all elements up to mid are present
   - This means the missing number must be in the higher indices

5. **Recursive Case 2 - Left Half Search**: If array[mid] doesn't equal mid, search the left half (start to mid)
   - This means the missing number is somewhere in the lower indices, including mid

The function efficiently finds the smallest missing non-negative integer in a sorted array using binary search recursion.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def find_First_Missing(array, start, end):
    """
    Find the smallest missing non-negative integer in a sorted array.
    
    This function uses binary search to efficiently locate the first missing
    number in O(log n) time complexity.
    
    Args:
        array: A sorted list of non-negative integers
        start: Starting index of the search range
        end: Ending index of the search range
    
    Returns:
        int: The smallest missing non-negative integer
    
    Example:
        >>> find_First_Missing([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0, 5)
        6
        >>> find_First_Missing([0, 1, 2, 4, 5], 0, 4)
        3
    """
    if (start > end): 
        return end + 1
    if (start != array[start]): 
        return start; 
    mid = int((start + end) / 2) 
    if (array[mid] == mid): 
        return find_First_Missing(array, mid+1, end) 
    return find_First_Missing(array, start, mid)
```
