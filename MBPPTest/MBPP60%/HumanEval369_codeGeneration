CodeGeneration:
ere `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.

This implementation is correct and efficient for finding the minimum of two numbers. Here's the complete function:

```python
def min_of_two(x, y):
    if x < y:
        return x
    return y
```

This function:
- Compares `x` and `y` using the less than operator
- Returns `x` if it's smaller than `y`
- Returns `y` in all other cases (when `y` is smaller or equal to `x`)
- Handles all numeric types (integers, floats) and any other types that support comparison with `<`
