def odd_position(nums):
	return all(nums[i]%2==i%2 for i in range(len(nums)))
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: The function checks if every element at position `i` has the same parity (odd/even) as the index `i` itself.
2. Analyze the implementation: 
   - Uses a generator expression with `all()` to check all elements
   - For each index `i`, compares `nums[i] % 2` (parity of element) with `i % 2` (parity of index)
   - Returns `True` only if all elements match their index parity
3. Note the
