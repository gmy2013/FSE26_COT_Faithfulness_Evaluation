The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sum_Range_list` takes three parameters: `nums` (a list of numbers), `m` (the start index), and `n` (the end index).
2. Initialize a variable `sum_range` to 0 to accumulate the sum.
3. Use a `for` loop to iterate from index `m` to index `n` (inclusive). The `range` function is called with `m` as start, `n+1` as stop (to include `n`), and step
