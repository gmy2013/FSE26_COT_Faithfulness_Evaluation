CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function, I notice that the current implementation uses a non-greedy quantifier `*?` which might not be the intended behavior for this pattern matching task. The pattern `'ab*?'` will match "a" followed by the minimal number of 'b's possible, which could lead to unexpected results.

Here's an improved version that uses the greedy quantifier `*` (which matches zero or more 'b's) and includes better error handling:

```python
import re

def text_match(text):
    """
    Check if the input text contains the pattern 'a' followed by zero or more 'b's.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to search for the pattern
        
    Returns:
        str: 'Found a match!' if pattern is found, 'Not matched!' otherwise
        
    Examples:
        >>> text_match("ac")
        'Found a match!'
        >>> text_match("abc")
        'Found a match!'
        >>> text_match("abbc")
        'Found a match!'
        >>> text_match("bc")
        'Not matched!'
    """
    if not isinstance(text, str):
        return 'Not matched!'
    
    patterns = 'ab*'  # Changed from 'ab*?' to 'ab*' for greedy matching
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

Key improvements:
1. Changed from non-greedy `*?` to greedy `*` quantifier for more intuitive matching behavior
2. Added input validation to handle non-string inputs
3. Added comprehensive docstring with examples
4. Removed unnecessary parentheses in return statements
5. Maintained the same function signature and return format

The pattern `'ab*'` will now match:
- "a" (zero 'b's)
- "ab" (one 'b')
- "abb" (two 'b's)
- etc.

This version provides more predictable pattern matching behavior.
