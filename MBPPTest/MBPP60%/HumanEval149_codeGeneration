CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, I can see that the function needs to be modified to avoid mutating the original list. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def add_tuple(test_list, test_tup):
    """
    Add elements from a tuple to a list and return a new list.
    
    This function creates a new list by extending the original list with
    elements from the tuple, without modifying the original list.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): The original list to be extended
        test_tup (tuple): The tuple whose elements will be added to the list
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all elements from test_list followed by all elements from test_tup
    """
    # Create a new list by concatenating the original list and the tuple
    # This avoids modifying the original list passed as argument
    return test_list + list(test_tup)
```

The key changes made:
1. Used `+` operator instead of `+=` to create a new list rather than modifying the original
2. Converted the tuple to a list using `list(test_tup)` to ensure proper concatenation
3. Added comprehensive docstring explaining the function behavior
4. The function now returns a new list without mutating the input list
