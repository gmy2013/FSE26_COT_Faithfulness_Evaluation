The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the is_triangleexists function:

1. **Check for non-zero angles**: Verify that all three angles (a, b, c) are non-zero values
2. **Check angle sum condition**: Confirm that the sum of all three angles equals 180 degrees (fundamental triangle property)
3. **Check triangle inequality**: Verify that the sum of any two angles is greater than or equal to the third angle
   - This ensures the angles can form a valid triangle (since in any triangle,
