CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought provided, the function implementation is already correct. The function compares two lists using the `==` operator and returns the boolean result directly.

```python
def check_identical(test_list1, test_list2):
    res = test_list1 == test_list2
    return (res)
```

This implementation:
- Takes two lists as input parameters
- Uses the `==` operator to compare them element-wise (checking both content and order)
- Returns the boolean result directly
- Is concise and efficient for the intended purpose

The function will return `True` if both lists have the same elements in the same order, and `False` otherwise.
