CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, here's the complete function implementation:

```python
def count_digs(tup):
    return sum([len(str(ele)) for ele in tup])

def sort_list(test_list):
    test_list.sort(key=count_digs)
    return str(test_list)
```

This implementation:
- Defines `count_digs()` that takes a tuple and returns the sum of digit lengths for all elements
- Defines `sort_list()` that sorts the input list using `count_digs` as the key function
- Returns the sorted list converted to a string representation

The function will sort tuples in the list based on their total digit count (sum of lengths when converted to strings).
