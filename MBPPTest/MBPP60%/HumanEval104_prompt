def sort_sublists(list1):
      list1.sort()  
      list1.sort(key=len)
      return  list1

1. The function `sort_sublists` takes a list of sublists as input.
2. First, it sorts the sublists lexicographically (alphabetically/numerically) using `list1.sort()`.
3. Then, it sorts the sublists again, but this time by their length using `list1.sort(key=len)`.
4. Since Python's sort is stable when using the same key, but here different keys are used, the final order is primar
