CodeGeneration:
the count in the defaultdict `res` by 1.
5. Convert the defaultdict to a regular dictionary and then to a string representation.
6. Return the string representation of the frequency dictionary.

Here's the complete function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def freq_element(test_tup):
    res = defaultdict(int)
    for ele in test_tup:
        res[ele] += 1
    return str(dict(res))
```
