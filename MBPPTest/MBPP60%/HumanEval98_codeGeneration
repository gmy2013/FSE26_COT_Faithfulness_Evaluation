CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function with the implementation logic:

```python
def min_Swaps(str1, str2):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of swaps needed to transform str1 into str2.
    
    Args:
        str1 (str): The original string
        str2 (str): The target string
    
    Returns:
        int: Minimum number of swaps required, or "Not Possible" if transformation is impossible
    """
    # Check if strings have the same length
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        return "Not Possible"
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            count += 1
    
    if count % 2 == 0:
        return count // 2
    else:
        return "Not Possible"
```

**Key improvements made:**
1. Added input validation to ensure both strings have the same length
2. Added proper docstring documentation
3. Maintained the core logic you described:
   - Count mismatches between the two strings
   - If even number of mismatches, return half of them (each swap fixes 2 mismatches)
   - If odd number of mismatches, return "Not Possible"

The function handles the case where strings have different lengths by returning "Not Possible" immediately, as swapping cannot make strings of different lengths equal.
