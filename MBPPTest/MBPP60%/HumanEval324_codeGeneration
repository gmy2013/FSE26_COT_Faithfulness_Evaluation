CodeGeneration:
ultiply the current product by `x` to accumulate the product of all elements.
6. Return the final product.

However, note that the function name has a typo: it should be `multiple_tuple` (with an 'i') instead of `mutiple_tuple`. But since the problem states the function name as given, we'll keep it as is.

Here is the corrected and completed code:

```python
def mutiple_tuple(nums):
    temp = list(nums)
    product = 1 
    for x in temp:
        product *= x
    return product
```

This function correctly calculates the product of all elements in the input tuple.
