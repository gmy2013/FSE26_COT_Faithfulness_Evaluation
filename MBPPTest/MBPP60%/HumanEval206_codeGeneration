CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete implementation of the function:

```python
def first_odd(nums):
    """Return the first odd number in a list, or -1 if no odd numbers exist.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of numbers to search through
        
    Returns:
        int: First odd number found, or -1 if no odd numbers exist
        
    Examples:
        >>> first_odd([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
        -1
        >>> first_odd([2, 4, 7, 8, 10])
        7
        >>> first_odd([])
        -1
    """
    first_odd = next((el for el in nums if el % 2 != 0), -1)
    return first_odd
```

The implementation uses:
- A generator expression `(el for el in nums if el % 2 != 0)` that yields only odd numbers
- The `next()` function with a default value of `-1` to return the first element from the generator
- If no odd numbers exist, the generator won't yield anything and `next()` returns the default value `-1`
- This approach is efficient as it stops iterating once the first odd number is found
