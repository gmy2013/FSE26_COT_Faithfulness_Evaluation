def max_run_uppercase(test_str):

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_run_uppercase` aims to find the maximum consecutive uppercase letters in a string.
2. Initialize `cnt` to 0 to count current consecutive uppercase letters and `res` to 0 to store the maximum found.
3. Iterate through each character in the string using an index.
4. For each character, if it is uppercase, increment `cnt`.
5. If it is not uppercase, update `res` to the maximum of `res` and `cnt` (but current code sets `res = cnt` without comparing), then reset `cnt` to 0.
6. After the loop, handle the case where the string ends with uppercase letters by updating `res` to the maximum of `res` and `cnt`.
7. Return `res`.

However, there is a bug in the code: when a non-uppercase character is found, it
