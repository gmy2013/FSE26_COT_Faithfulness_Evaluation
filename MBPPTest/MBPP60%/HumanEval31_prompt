def move_zero(num_list):
    a = [0 for i in range(num_list.count(0))]
    x = [ i for i in num_list if i != 0]
    x.extend(a)
    return (x)
The following is chain of thought:
1. Count zeros: Use `count(0)` to determine how many zeros are in `num_list`.
2. Create zero list: Generate a list `a` with that many zeros using list comprehension.
3. Filter non-zero elements: Create list `x` containing all elements from `num_list` th
