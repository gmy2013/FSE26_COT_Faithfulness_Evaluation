def is_odd(n) : 
    if (n^1 == n-1) :
        return True; 
    else :
        return False; 
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze the function `is_odd(n)`:

The function uses bitwise XOR (^) to check if a number is odd. Here's how it works:
- For odd numbers: n^1 equals n-1
- For even numbers: n^1 equals n+1

Example with n=3 (odd):
3 in binary: 11
1 in binary: 01
XOR: 11 ^ 01 = 10 (which is 2, and 3-1=2) → True

Example with n=4 (even):
4 in binary: 100
1 in binary: 001
XOR: 100 ^ 001 = 101 (which is 5, and 4-1=3) → False

The logic is correct, but the implementation can be simplified. Instead of using if-else, we can directly return the boolean expression.

Chain of thought:
