    for value in iterable:

    return [hq.heappop(h) for i in range(len(h))]
The following is chain of thought:
1. Initialize an empty list `h` to serve as the heap.
2. Iterate through each element in the input `iterable`.
3. For each element, push it onto the heap `h` using `heapq.heappush`, which maintains the min-heap property.
4. After building the heap, construct the sorted list by
