CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, the function appears to be correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def harmonic_sum(n):
    """
    Compute the sum of the harmonic series from 1 to n using recursion.
    
    The harmonic series is defined as: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the harmonic series (must be positive integer)
    
    Returns:
        float: The sum of the harmonic series from 1 to n
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is not a positive integer
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    
    if n == 1:
        return 1.0
    else:
        return 1.0 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)
```

**Key improvements made:**
1. Added proper docstring with parameter and return type documentation
2. Added input validation to ensure n is a positive integer
3. Used float literals (1.0) for better clarity that we're working with floating-point arithmetic
4. Changed the base case condition from `n < 2` to `n == 1` for clarity
5. Added error handling for invalid inputs

The recursive logic remains the same as your original implementation, which correctly computes the harmonic series sum.
