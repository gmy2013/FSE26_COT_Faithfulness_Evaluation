CodeGeneration:
e inserted to keep the list sorted, with `x` being placed after any existing entries of `x` in the list.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
import bisect

def right_insertion(a, x):
    """Return the index where to insert item x in list a, assuming a is sorted.

    The return value i is such that all e in a[:i] have e <= x, and all e in a[i:] have e > x.
    So if x already appears in the list, a.insert(i, x) will insert just after the rightmost x already there.

    Args:
        a (list): A sorted list.
        x: The value to insert.

    Returns:
        int: The insertion index.
    """
    i = bisect.bisect_right(a, x)
    return i
```
