CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function with the corrected docstring:

```python
import re

def remove_multiple_spaces(text1):
    """
    Remove multiple consecutive spaces from a string and replace them with a single space.
    
    Args:
        text1 (str): The input string containing multiple spaces
        
    Returns:
        str: The cleaned string with multiple spaces replaced by single spaces
        
    Example:
        >>> remove_multiple_spaces("Hello    world!  How   are you?")
        'Hello world! How are you?'
    """
    return (re.sub(' +',' ',text1))
```

The function uses a regular expression pattern `' +'` which matches one or more space characters, and replaces them with a single space `' '` using the `re.sub()` method. This effectively collapses multiple consecutive spaces into single spaces throughout the input string.
