def max_similar_indices(test_list1, test_list2):

The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for implementing the max_similar_indices function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function takes two lists of tuples (test_list1 and test_list2) and returns a new list where each tuple contains the maximum values from corresponding positions

2. **Input Structure**: Both input lists contain tuples with exactly two elements (x, y coordinates), and the lists are of equal length

3. **Core Operation**: For each pair of corresponding tuples from both lists:
   - Compare the first elements (x[0] vs y[0]) and take the maximum
   - Compare the second elements (x[1] vs y[1]) and take the maximum
   - Create a new tuple with these maxi
