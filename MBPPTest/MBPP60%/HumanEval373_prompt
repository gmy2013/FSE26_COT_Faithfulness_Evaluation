The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the min_sum_path function:

1. **Initialization**: Create a memoization array of the same length as the input list A, initially filled with None values

2. **Base Case Setup**: 
   - Get the index of the last row (n = len(A) - 1)
   - Initialize the memo array with the values from the bottom row of the triangle (A[n])

3. **Bottom-up Processing**:
   - Iterate from the second-to-last row up to the top row (i from len(A)-2 down to 0)
   - For each row, iterate through all elements in that row (j from 0 to len(A[i])-1)
   - Update each memo position: current element value + minimum of the two possible paths below (memo[j] and memo[j+1])

4. **Result Extraction**: Return memo[0], which now contains the minimum sum path from top to botto
