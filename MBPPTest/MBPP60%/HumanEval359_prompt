def get_noOfways(n):
    if (n == 0):
        return 0;
    if (n == 1):
        return 1; 
    return get_noOfways(n - 1) + get_noOfways(n - 2);
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing the function:

1. **Function Purpose Identification**: The function `get_noOfways(n)` appears to be calculating the number of ways to reach step `n` by taking 1 or 2 steps at a time, which is the Fibonacci sequence.

2. **Base Cases Analysis**:
   - When `n == 0`, returns 0 (no ways to reach step 0 in typical step problems).
   - When `n == 1`, returns 1 (only one way: single step).

3. **Recursive Case Analysis**:
   - For `n > 1`, returns the sum of `get_noOfways(n-1)` and `get_noOfways(n-2)`.
   - This follows the Fibonacci recurrence relation: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

4. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - The implementation uses naive recursion, leading to exponential time complexity O(2^n) due to repeated calculations.
   - This is inefficient for large `n` and could be optimized with memoization or iterative
