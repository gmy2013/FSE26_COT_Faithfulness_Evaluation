CodeGeneration:
omprehension `[list(ele) for ele in ...]` converts each tuple to a list.
6. The final result is a list of lists where each inner list contains elements from the same position in each original sublist.

Therefore, the function correctly transposes the input list of lists.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def merge(lst):  
    return [list(ele) for ele in list(zip(*lst))]
```
