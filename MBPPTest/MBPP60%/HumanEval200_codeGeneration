CodeGeneration:
is less than 3. Specifically:
     - If length is 2, there is one duplicate (two values are equal, one is different), so return 1 (since 4-2=2, but wait, that doesn't match the expected behavior).
   Actually, looking at the code: it returns `4 - len(result)`. Let's verify:
     - If all distinct: len=3 → return 1? But the condition says return 0. There's a discrepancy.

Wait, the code provided has:
  if len(result)==3:
    return 0
  else:
    return (4-len(result))

But for distinct values (len=3), it returns 0, not 1. So the logic is:
   - If all distinct: return 0
   - If two equal (len=2): return 2 (4-2=2)
   - If all equal (len=1): return 3 (4-1=3)

This seems to be counting the number of equal values? Actually, it returns:
   - 0 for no duplicates (all distinct)
   - 2 for one duplicate (two equal)
   - 3 for all three equal

But typically, for such functions, we might want to return the count of duplicates or a different measure.

Perhaps the intended behavior is to return the number of pairs that are equal? But with three values, there can be 0, 1 (if two equal), or 3 (if all equal) pairs.

Alternatively, it might be returning the number of values that are not unique? For example:
   - All distinct: 0 non-unique
   - Two equal: 2 non-unique (since one value appears twice, so two instances are non-unique)
   - All equal: 3 non-unique

Indeed, `4 - len(set)` gives:
   len(set)=3 → 1, but code returns 0. So there's an off-by-one.

Actually, the code returns 0 for len=3, and 4-len otherwise. So:
   len=3 → 0
   len=2 → 2
   len=1 → 3

This matches the number of non-unique values: 
   - For distinct: 0 non-unique
   - For two equal: 2 non-unique (the two that are equal)
   - For all equal: 3 non-unique

So the function returns the count of values that are not unique (i.e., that have duplicates).

Therefore, the function is correct as written.

To complete the function based on the docstring? The user did not provide a docstring in the query. They provided the function code and a chain of thought.

But the instruction says: "Complete the following function based on the given docstring." However, no docstring was given. Perhaps it was omitted.

Given that, I'll assume the function is already implemented as intended, and the chain of thought explains it.

Since the function is already complete, I don't need to change it.

However, if I were to write a docstring for it, it would be:

"""Return the number of non-unique values among x, y, z.

Args:
    x: First value.
    y: Second value.
    z: Third value.

Returns:
    0 if all values are distinct, 2 if two are equal (and one different), 3 if all three are equal.
"""

But the user asked to complete the function, not to write a docstring. And the function is already there.

So I think the response should be just the function as given, since it's complete.

But to be helpful, I can output the function with a docstring.

Given the ambiguity, I'll provide the function with a docstring that matches the behavior.
```python
def test_three_equal(x, y, z):
    """Return the number of non-unique values among x, y, z.

    Args:
        x: First value.
        y: Second value.
        z: Third value.

    Returns:
        0 if all values are distinct, 2 if exactly two are equal, 3 if all three are equal.
    """
    result = set([x, y, z])
    if len(result) == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return 4 - len(result)
```
