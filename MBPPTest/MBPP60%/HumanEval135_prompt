def left_insertion(a, x):
    i = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
    return i
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `left_insertion` takes a sorted list `a` and a value `x`.
2. It uses `bisect.bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `x` in `a` to maintain sorted order.
3. This insertion point is the index where `x` would be inserted to keep the list sorted, with a
