def extract_unique(test_dict):

  return res
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `extract_unique` takes a dictionary `test_dict` as input.
2. The goal is to extract all unique elements from all the values in the dictionary.
3. The values are assumed to be iterable (e.g., lists, sets, tuples).
4. Use a set comprehension to iterate over each value in `test_dict.values()`.
5. For each value (which is an iterable),
