The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `Check_Solution` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It calculates the discriminant of a quadratic equation using the formula `(b*b) - (4*a*c)`.
3. The discriminant determines the number of real solutions:
   - If the discriminant is greater than 0, there are two distinct real solutions.
   - If the discriminant is equal to 0, there is exactly one real solution (a repeated root).
   - If the discriminant is
