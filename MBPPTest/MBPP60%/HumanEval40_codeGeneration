Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def is_nonagonal(n):
    """Return the nth nonagonal number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the nonagonal number sequence (1-based index)
    
    Returns:
        int: The nth nonagonal number calculated using the formula n*(7n-5)/2
    """
    return int(n * (7 * n - 5) / 2)
```

The function correctly implements the formula for the nth nonagonal number, which is n*(7n-5)/2. The int() conversion ensures the result is returned as an integer since the formula always produces integer results for integer inputs.
