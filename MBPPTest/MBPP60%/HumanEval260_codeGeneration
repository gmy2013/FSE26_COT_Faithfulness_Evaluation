CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function with the completed docstring:

```python
from collections import Counter 

def anagram_lambda(texts, str):
    """
    Filter a list of strings to find all anagrams of a target string.
    
    Args:
        texts (list): List of strings to search through
        str (string): Target string to find anagrams of
    
    Returns:
        list: List of strings from texts that are anagrams of str
    """
    result = list(filter(lambda x: (Counter(str) == Counter(x)), texts)) 
    return result
```

The function filters the input list `texts` to return only those strings that are anagrams of the target string `str`, using `Counter` objects to compare character frequencies.
