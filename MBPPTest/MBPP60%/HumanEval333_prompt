def dealnnoy_num(n, m): 
	if (m == 0 or n == 0) : 
		return 1
	return dealnnoy_num(m - 1, n) + dealnnoy_num(m - 1, n - 1) + dealnnoy_num(m, n - 1)
The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the given recursive function for computing the Dealnnoy number:

The Dealnnoy number D(m, n) counts the number of paths from (0, 0) to (m, n) in a grid, using only steps north (↑), east (→), or northeast (↗).

The recursive definition is:
- Base case: If either m or n is 0, there is exactly 1 path (all moves in one direction).
- Recursive case: D(m, n) = D(m-1, n) + D(m-1, n-1) + D(m, n-1)

However, the given function has the parameters reversed: it defines `dealnnoy_num(n, m)` but uses the recursion with `m` and `n` swapped in the calls. This will lead to incorrect results because the recurrence is defined for D(m, n), not D(n, m).

To fix this, we should either:
1. Swap the parameters in the function definition to `dealnnoy_num(m, n)`, or
2. Adjust the recursive calls to match the parameter order.

Since the function is named with `n` first and `m` second, we should correct the recursive calls to be consistent with the parameter order.

Corrected recursive calls:
- Instead of `dealnnoy_num(m - 1, n)`, it should be `dealnnoy_num(n, m - 1)` to compute D(m-1, n).
- Instead of `dealnnoy_num(m - 1, n - 1)`, it should be `dealnnoy_num(n - 1, m - 1)` to compute D(m-1, n-1).
- Instead of `dealnnoy_num(m, n - 1)`, it should be `dealnnoy_num(n - 1, m)` to compute D(m, n-1).

Therefore, the corrected function is:

```python
def dealnnoy_num(n, m): 
    if (m == 0 or n == 0): 
        return 1
    return
