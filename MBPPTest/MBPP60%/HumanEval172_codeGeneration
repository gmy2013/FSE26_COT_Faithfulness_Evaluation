CodeGeneration:
e matched substring (using slicing `text[s:e]`), the start index, and the end index.

However, there's an issue with the current implementation: it only returns the first occurrence and ignores any subsequent matches. Based on the function name `occurance_substring` (which appears to be a misspelling of "occurrence"), it seems like it should handle multiple occurrences.

Here's the corrected function that returns all occurrences:

```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text, pattern):
    """
    Find all occurrences of a pattern in a text string.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The string to search in
        pattern (str): The regex pattern to search for
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples, each containing (substring, start_index, end_index)
              for each occurrence found
    """
    occurrences = []
    for match in re.finditer(pattern, text):
        s = match.start()
        e = match.end()
        occurrences.append((text[s:e], s, e))
    return occurrences
```

If you specifically want only the first occurrence (as in the original code), here's the corrected version with proper documentation:

```python
import re
def occurance_substring(text, pattern):
    """
    Find the first occurrence of a pattern in a text string.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The string to search in
        pattern (str): The regex pattern to search for
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing (substring, start_index, end_index) for the first occurrence,
               or None if no match is found
    """
    for match in re.finditer(pattern, text):
        s = match.start()
        e = match.end()
        return (text[s:e], s, e)
    return None
```
