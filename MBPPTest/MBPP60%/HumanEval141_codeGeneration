CodeGeneration:
The total surface area is 4 times the area of one face: 4 * (√3/4)*side² = √3*side²

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import math

def area_tetrahedron(side):
    """Calculate the surface area of a regular tetrahedron.
    
    Args:
        side (float): Length of one side of the tetrahedron
        
    Returns:
        float: Total surface area of the tetrahedron
    """
    area = math.sqrt(3) * (side ** 2)
    return area
```

The function correctly calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron as √3 × side².
