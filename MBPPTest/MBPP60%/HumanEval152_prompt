def min_k(test_list, K):
  res = sorted(test_list, key = lambda x: x[1])[:K]
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the min_k function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function takes a list of tuples and returns the K smallest elements based on the second element of each tuple.

2. **Sorting Strategy**: 
   - Use Python's built-in sorted() function to sort the input list
   - Apply a lambda function as the key parameter to extract the second element (x[1]) from each tuple for comparison
   - This ensures sorting is based on the second element of each tuple

3. **Slicing Operation**: 
   - After sorting, use slice notation [:K] to extract the first K eleme
