CodeGeneration:
**Critical Issue Identification**:
The function attempts to modify a tuple in-place, but tuples are immutable in Python. This will raise a `TypeError` when trying to swap elements.

**Corrected Implementation**:
```python
def sort_tuple(tup):
    """
    Sorts a tuple of tuples based on the first element of each inner tuple.
    
    Args:
        tup: A tuple containing inner tuples (each inner tuple must have at least one element)
    
    Returns:
        A new tuple sorted by the first element of each inner tuple in ascending order
    """
    # Convert to list for mutability, sort, then convert back to tuple
    lst = list(tup)
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if lst[j][0] > lst[j + 1][0]:
                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]
    return tuple(lst)
```

**Alternative More Pythonic Implementation**:
```python
def sort_tuple(tup):
    """
    Sorts a tuple of tuples based on the first element of each inner tuple.
    
    Args:
        tup: A tuple containing inner tuples (each inner tuple must have at least one element)
    
    Returns:
        A new tuple sorted by the first element of each inner tuple in ascending order
    """
    return tuple(sorted(tup, key=lambda x: x[0]))
```

The second implementation is more efficient (O(n log n) vs O(nÂ²)) and follows Python's built-in sorting capabilities while maintaining the tuple return type.
