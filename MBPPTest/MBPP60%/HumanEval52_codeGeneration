CodeGeneration:
h key-value pair, append the value `v` to the list associated with key `k` in the dictionary.
5. Return the resulting dictionary.

Here is the complete function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def grouping_dictionary(l):
    """
    Groups values by their keys from a list of key-value pairs.
    
    Args:
        l (list): A list of tuples where each tuple is (key, value)
    
    Returns:
        defaultdict: A dictionary where keys map to lists of values
    """
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for k, v in l:
        d[k].append(v)
    return d
```
