CodeGeneration:
The function `count_same_pair` is already complete and correctly implemented. Here's the full code with the completed docstring:

```python
from operator import eq

def count_same_pair(nums1, nums2):
    """
    Count the number of index positions where the elements in nums1 and nums2 are equal.
    
    Args:
        nums1 (list): First list of numbers
        nums2 (list): Second list of numbers
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of positions where nums1[i] == nums2[i]
    
    Example:
        >>> count_same_pair([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4])
        2
        >>> count_same_pair([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])
        1
    """
    result = sum(map(eq, nums1, nums2))
    return result
```

The function works exactly as described in your chain of thought:
- `map(eq, nums1, nums2)` applies the equality operator to corresponding elements
- This returns an iterator of boolean values (True/False)
- `sum()` treats True as 1 and False as 0, giving the count of equal pairs
- The function returns this count as the result
