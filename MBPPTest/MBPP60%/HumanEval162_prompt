The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `find_Min_Diff` takes an array `arr` and its length `n`.
2. The goal is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
3. First, sort the array to bring close values next to each other.
4. Initialize `diff` to a very large number (10**20) to ensure any actual difference will be smaller.
5. Iterate through the sorted array fro
