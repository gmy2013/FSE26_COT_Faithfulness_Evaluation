4. In each iteration, add the element at the current index `i` from the list `nums` to `sum_range`.
5. After the loop, return the accumulated sum `sum_range`.

The code is already correct and complete as per the docstring. Here is the function again for clarity:

```python
def sum_Range_list(nums, m, n):
    sum_range = 0
    for i in range(m, n+1, 1):
        sum_range += nums[i]
    return sum_range
```
