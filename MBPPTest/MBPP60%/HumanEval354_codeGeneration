CodeGeneration:
he code as provided already correctly implements the function. Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def is_abundant(n):
    """Check if a number is abundant.
    
    An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors
    (excluding itself) is greater than the number itself.
    
    Args:
        n (int): A positive integer to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n is abundant, False otherwise
    """
    fctrsum = sum([fctr for fctr in range(1, n) if n % fctr == 0])
    return fctrsum > n
```

The implementation follows your chain of thought:
1. It finds all proper divisors using a list comprehension that iterates from 1 to n-1
2. It calculates the sum of these divisors
3. It returns True if the sum is greater than n, False otherwise

The code is correct and efficient for the given problem.
