CodeGeneration:
I notice there's an issue with the current implementation. The function is adding elements in a way that might not be intuitive - it's adding the first tuple's elements to the second tuple's elements, but the variable naming suggests it should be the other way around.

Here's the corrected and improved version:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_combinations(test_list):
    """
    Generate all combinations of pairs from the input list and return
    a list of tuples where each tuple contains the element-wise sum
    of the two tuples in each combination.
    
    Args:
        test_list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements
        
    Returns:
        A list of tuples, where each tuple is the element-wise sum of
        two tuples from the input list
        
    Example:
        >>> find_combinations([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)])
        [(4, 6), (6, 8), (8, 10)]
    """
    res = [(a1 + b1, a2 + b2) for (a1, a2), (b1, b2) in combinations(test_list, 2)]
    return res
```

The key changes:
1. Fixed the addition order to be more intuitive: `(a1 + b1, a2 + b2)` instead of `(b1 + a1, b2 + a2)`
2. Added comprehensive docstring with parameter description, return description, and example
3. Cleaned up the formatting for better readability

The function now takes all unique pairs of tuples from the input list and returns their element-wise sums.
