CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought and the provided function, here's the complete implementation:

```python
def sorted_models(models):
    """Sort a list of model dictionaries by their color attribute.
    
    Args:
        models: A list of dictionaries, each representing a model with a 'color' key
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list of model dictionaries sorted by color in ascending order
    """
    sorted_models = sorted(models, key=lambda x: x['color'])
    return sorted_models
```

This function:
- Takes a list of dictionaries as input
- Uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function to create a new sorted list
- Uses a lambda function as the key to extract the 'color' value from each dictionary
- Returns the sorted list in ascending alphabetical order based on color values
- Maintains the original list unchanged (creates a new sorted list)
