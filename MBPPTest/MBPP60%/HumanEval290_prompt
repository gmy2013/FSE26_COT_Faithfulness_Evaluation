def same_Length(A,B): 
    while (A > 0 and B > 0): 
        A = A / 10; 
        B = B / 10; 
    if (A == 0 and B == 0): 
        return True; 
    return False; 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `same_Length` aims to check if two integers A and B have the same number of digits.
2. The current implementation uses a while loop to repeatedly divide both numbers by 10 until at least one becomes zero.
3. After the loop, it checks if both numbers are zero to return True (same length) or False otherwise.
4. However, this approach has a flaw: dividing integers by 10 in Python may produce floats (e.g., 1/10 becomes 0.1), which can lead to incorrect comparisons.
5. To fix this, integer division (//) should be used instead of float division (/) to ensure we are working with integers.
6. Additionally, the condition should check for both numbers being exactly zero after the same number of divisions.
7. Revised plan: use integer division by 10 in the while loop to cou
