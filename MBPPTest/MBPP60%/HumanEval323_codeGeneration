CodeGeneration:
The function you provided is already complete and correct. It returns the maximum of two numbers by comparing `x` and `y` and returning the larger value.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def max_of_two(x, y):
    if x > y:
        return x
    return y
```

This implementation:
- Returns `x` if `x` is greater than `y`
- Returns `y` in all other cases (when `y` is greater than or equal to `x`)

The function works correctly for all numeric types (integers, floats) and any other types that support the `>` comparison operator.
