al `sum`.
4. Finally, the function returns the total sum.

However, note that the formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` odd numbers is known to be `n^2 * (2*n^2 - 1)`. This closed-form formula can be used for a more efficient computation without a loop.

Let's implement the function using the closed-form formula for better performance, especially for large `n`.

```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of odd terms to consider.

    Returns:
        int: Sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers.
    """
    return n * n * (2 * n * n - 1)
```

This implementation is efficient and concise, leveraging the mathematical identity for the sum.
