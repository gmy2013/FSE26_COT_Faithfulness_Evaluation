CodeGeneration:
igns are correctly mapped, but note that 'sheep' should be capitalized for consistency ('Sheep').
6. The last case (remainder 11) is correctly assigned to 'Hare'.

Here is the improved function with consistent capitalization and a more efficient approach using a list:

```python
def chinese_zodiac(year):
    """
    Calculate the Chinese zodiac sign for a given year.

    The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle, with each year assigned an animal sign.
    The cycle starts from the year 2000 which is the Dragon year (remainder 0).

    Parameters:
    year (int): The year for which to determine the zodiac sign.

    Returns:
    str: The Chinese zodiac sign corresponding to the input year.

    Examples:
    >>> chinese_zodiac(2000)
    'Dragon'
    >>> chinese_zodiac(2023)
    'Rabbit'  # Note: 2023 is Rabbit year, which corresponds to Hare in some systems
    """
    signs = ['Dragon', 'Snake', 'Horse', 'Sheep', 'Monkey', 'Rooster', 
             'Dog', 'Pig', 'Rat', 'Ox', 'Tiger', 'Hare']
    remainder = (year - 2000) % 12
    return signs[remainder]
```

This implementation:
1. Uses a list for cleaner, more maintainable code
2. Provides proper documentation with examples
3. Maintains consistent capitalization
4. Handles all cases efficiently with O(1) lookup time
5. Includes the note about 'Hare' vs 'Rabbit' terminology in the docstring
