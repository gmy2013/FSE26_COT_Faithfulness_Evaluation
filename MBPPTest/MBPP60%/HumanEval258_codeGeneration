CodeGeneration:
ays is for valid ranges of `i`), it extends the `subs` list with these combinations.
6. Finally, it returns the list `subs` containing all sublists.

However, note that the condition `if len(temp)>0` is redundant because for `i` in `range(0, len(my_list)+1)`, `combinations` will always return at least one combination (for example, when `i=0`, it returns one empty combination). So we can simplify the code.

Here is the improved version:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def sub_lists(my_list):
    subs = []
    for i in range(0, len(my_list)+1):
        temp = [list(x) for x in combinations(my_list, i)]
        subs.extend(temp)
    return subs
```

But note: the original function already works correctly. The above is just a minor optimization.

Alternatively, we can write it more concisely using a list comprehension:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def sub_lists(my_list):
    return [list(x) for i in range(len(my_list)+1) for x in combinations(my_list, i)]
```

This single-line version is equivalent and more Pythonic.

So the final code is:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def sub_lists(my_list):
    return [list(x) for i in range(len(my_list)+1) for x in combinations(my_list, i)]
```
