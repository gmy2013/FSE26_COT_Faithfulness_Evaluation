CodeGeneration:
re than the previous, increment count.
   - Otherwise, reset count to 1.
   - Update ans with the maximum value.
5. Return ans.

Here's the complete function with improved code style and comments:

```python
def find_longest_conseq_subseq(arr, n):
    """
    Find the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in an array.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        int: Length of the longest consecutive subsequence
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the array to group consecutive numbers
    arr.sort()
    
    # Remove duplicates while preserving order
    unique_arr = []
    unique_arr.append(arr[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            unique_arr.append(arr[i])
    
    count = 1  # Current consecutive sequence length
    ans = 1    # Maximum consecutive sequence length
    
    # Iterate through unique elements to find longest consecutive sequence
    for i in range(1, len(unique_arr)):
        if unique_arr[i] == unique_arr[i - 1] + 1:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 1  # Reset count if not consecutive
        ans = max(ans, count)
    
    return ans
```

This implementation:
1. Handles edge case of empty array
2. Uses more descriptive variable names
3. Includes proper docstring documentation
4. Maintains the same O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting
5. Uses efficient space by removing duplicates in a single pass

The function finds the longest sequence of consecutive integers in the array, where consecutive means numbers that follow each other in numerical order (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4]).
