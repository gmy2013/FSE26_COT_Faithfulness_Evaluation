Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
import bisect

def left_insertion(a, x):
    """Return the index where to insert item x in list a, assuming a is sorted.

    The return value i is such that all e in a[:i] have e < x, and all e in
    a[i:] have e >= x.  So if x already appears in the list, a.insert(i, x) will
    insert just before the leftmost x already there.
    
    Args:
        a: A sorted list
        x: The value to find the insertion point for
        
    Returns:
        int: The insertion index
    """
    i = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
    return i
```

The function uses `bisect.bisect_left()` which returns the position where `x` should be inserted in the sorted list `a` to maintain sorted order. If `x` is already present in the list, it returns the position of the first occurrence of `x`.
