CodeGeneration:
se letter by comparing it to the range 'a' to 'z'.
5. If the character is lowercase, increment the counter.
6. After processing all characters, return the counter value.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def lower_ctr(str):
    lower_ctr = 0
    for i in range(len(str)):
        if str[i] >= 'a' and str[i] <= 'z':
            lower_ctr += 1
    return lower_ctr
```
