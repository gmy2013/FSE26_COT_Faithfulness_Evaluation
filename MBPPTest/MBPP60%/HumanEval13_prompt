def cummulative_sum(test_list):
  res = sum(map(sum, test_list))
  return (res)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `cummulative_sum` takes a list of lists `test_list` as input.
2. We need to compute the total sum of all elements in all sublists.
3. Use `map(sum, test_list)` to apply the `sum` function to each sublist, which returns
