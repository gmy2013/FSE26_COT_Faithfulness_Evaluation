def decreasing_trend(nums):
    if (sorted(nums)== nums):
        return True
    else:
        return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `decreasing_trend` should check if the list `nums` is in strictly decreasing order.
2. The current implementation checks if `nums` is equal to `sorted(nums)`, which would only return `True` if the list is in non-decreasing order (i.e., sorted ascending).
3. To check for strictly decreasing order, we should compare `nums` to `sorted(nums, reverse=True)`.
4. Additionally, we should ensure the list is strictly decreasing (no duplicates), so we must check for strict inequality in the
