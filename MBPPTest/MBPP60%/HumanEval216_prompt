def div_of_nums(nums,m,n):
 result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 or x % n == 0), nums)) 
 return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the function purpose**: The function `div_of_nums` takes a list `nums` and two integers `m` and `n`, and returns a new list containing elements from `nums` that are divisible by either `m` or `n`.
2. **Analyze the existing code**: The current implementation uses `filter` with a lambda function that checks if an element `x` is divisible by `m` OR `n` (using `x % m == 0 or x % n == 0`). This correctly implements the requirement.
3. **Verify correctness**: The logic is accurate - it filters numbers divisible by either divisor. The use of `or` ensures inclusion if e
