The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing and improving the prime number function:

1. **Identify the purpose**: The function should return True if a number is prime, False otherwise

2. **Analyze current implementation issues**:
   - The loop range `range(2, num//2)` should be `range(2, num//2 + 1)` to include the midpoint
   - The `else` clause inside the loop causes premature return - it returns True after checking only the first divisor
   - The condition `num >= 1` incorrectly includes 1, which is not a prime number
   - Edge cases like 0, 1, and 2 need special handling

3. **Plan the correct logic**:
   - Numbers ≤ 1 are not prime
   - 2 is the only even prime number
   - For numbers > 2, check divisibility from 2 to √num (optimization)
   - Only return True after checking all possible divisors

4. **Impl
