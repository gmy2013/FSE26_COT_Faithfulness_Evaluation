```python
def min_sum_path(A): 
    """
    Finds the minimum sum path from top to bottom in a triangular array using dynamic programming.
    
    The function uses a bottom-up approach where it starts from the bottom row and works upwards,
    storing the minimum path sum from each position to the bottom in a memoization array.
    
    Args:
        A: A list of lists representing a triangular array where each row has one more element
           than the previous row (e.g., [[2], [3,4], [6,5,7], [4,1,8,3]])
    
    Returns:
        int: The minimum sum path from the top to the bottom of the triangle
    """
    memo = [None] * len(A) 
    n = len(A) - 1
    for i in range(len(A[n])): 
        memo[i] = A[n][i] 
    for i in range(len(A) - 2, -1,-1):
