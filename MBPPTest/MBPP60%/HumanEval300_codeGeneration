CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and provide an improved implementation:

```python
def smallest_multiple(n):
    """
    Returns the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Upper bound of the range (1 to n)
    
    Returns:
        int: The smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to n
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Calculate LCM using the formula: LCM(a,b) = |a*b| / GCD(a,b)
    def gcd(a, b):
        """Calculate Greatest Common Divisor using Euclidean algorithm"""
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    
    def lcm(a, b):
        """Calculate Least Common Multiple"""
        return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    
    # Start with LCM of 1, then iteratively compute LCM with each number
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = lcm(result, i)
    
    return result
```

**Alternative optimized version using prime factorization:**

```python
def smallest_multiple(n):
    """
    Returns the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to n.
    Uses prime factorization method for better efficiency.
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Sieve of Eratosthenes to find primes up to n
    primes = []
    sieve = [True] * (n + 1)
    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            primes.append(i)
            for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    
    # For each prime, find the highest power that doesn't exceed n
    result = 1
    for p in primes:
        power = p
        while power * p <= n:
            power *= p
        result *= power
    
    return result
```

The prime factorization version is more efficient for larger values of n as it avoids the nested loops of the GCD/LCM approach. Both implementations correctly solve the problem of finding the smallest number divisible by all integers from 1 to n.
