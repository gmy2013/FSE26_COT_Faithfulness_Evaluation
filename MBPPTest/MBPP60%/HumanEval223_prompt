The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_even` takes a list `l` as input.
2. It iterates through each element `i` in the list `l`.
3. For each element, it checks if `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).
4. If the element is even, it removes that element from the list `l` using `l.remove(i)`.
5. After processing all eleme
