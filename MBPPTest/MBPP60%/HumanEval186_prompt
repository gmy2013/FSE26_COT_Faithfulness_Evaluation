import re
def text_match_three(text):
        patterns = 'ab{3}?'
        if re.search(patterns,  text):
                return 'Found a match!'
        else:
                return('Not matched!')
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `text_match_three` checks if the input string `text` contains the pattern 'ab{3}?'.
2. The regex pattern 'ab{3}?' means:
   - 'a' matches the literal character 'a'
   - 'b{3}?' matches exactly three 'b' characters (non-greedy quantifier, but since it's exact {3}, greediness doesn't matter)
3. So the pattern looks for the substring "abbb"
