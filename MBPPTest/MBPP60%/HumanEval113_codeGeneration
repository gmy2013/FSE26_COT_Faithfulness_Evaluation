, 1+2+3, etc. until the sum doesn't exceed the exponent)
5. **Remaining Prime**: If n > 1 after processing all factors, it means n itself is prime and counts as one divisor

Here's the complete function with improved comments:

```python
def count_Fac(n):
    """
    Count the number of distinct factorial divisors of a given number n.
    
    A factorial divisor is a divisor that can be expressed as k! for some integer k.
    This function calculates how many such distinct factorial divisors exist for n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to count factorial divisors for
        
    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct factorial divisors of n
        
    Example:
        >>> count_Fac(6)
        3  # 1!, 2!, 3! are divisors of 6
    """
    m = n  # Store original n for reference
    count = 0  # Count of factorial divisors
    i = 2  # Start with first prime
    
    # Factorize n and process each prime factor
    while (i * i) <= m:
        total = 0  # Exponent of current prime factor
        
        # Count exponent of current prime factor i
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
            total += 1
        
        # Calculate how many factorial divisors can be formed from this exponent
        temp = 0  # Running sum of triangular numbers
        j = 1  # Current triangular number index
        
        # Use triangular numbers pattern: 1, 1+2, 1+2+3, etc.
        while (temp + j) <= total:
            temp += j
            count += 1
            j += 1
        
        i += 1  # Move to next potential prime factor
    
    # Handle remaining prime factor (if n > 1, it's prime)
    if n != 1:
        count += 1
    
    return count
