        students (dict): Dictionary with student IDs as keys and tuples (height, weight) as values
        h (int/float): Minimum height threshold
        w (int/float): Minimum weight threshold
    
    Returns:
        dict: Filtered dictionary containing only students who meet both height and weight requirements
    """
    result = {k: s for k, s in students.items() if s[0] >= h and s[1] >= w}
