The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the count_Char function:

1. **Function Purpose**: Count occurrences of character `x` in the first `n` characters of a repeated string pattern
2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Initialize counter to 0
   - Set n = 10 (fixed value for repetition length)

3. **First Loop**: 
   - Iterate through original string to count occurrences of `x`
   - This establishes the base count for one full repetition

4. **Repetition Calculation**:
   - Calculate how many full string repetitions fit in n characters
   - Multiply base count by number of full repetitions

5. **Partial String Handling**:
   - Calculate remaining characters after full repetitions
   -
