CodeGeneration:
The function you provided is already correct and complete. Here's the implementation:

```python
def max_sum_list(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```

This function:
- Takes a list of lists as input
- Uses the `max()` function with `key=sum` to find the sublist with the highest sum
- Returns that sublist

Example usage:
```python
lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11]]
result = max_sum_list(lists)  # Returns [10, 11] (sum = 21)
```
