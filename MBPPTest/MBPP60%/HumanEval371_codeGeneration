CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought provided, the function implementation is correct. The `+` operator for tuples concatenates them while preserving their nested structure, which is exactly what's needed for this function.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def concatenate_nested(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = test_tup1 + test_tup2
  return (res)
```

This implementation:
- Takes two tuples as input
- Uses the `+` operator to concatenate them into a new tuple
- Returns the concatenated result while maintaining any nested tuple structures within the input tuples
- Works correctly for both flat tuples and tuples containing nested tuples
