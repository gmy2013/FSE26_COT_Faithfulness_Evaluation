CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the chain of thought continued:

```python
def min_jumps(arr, n):
    jumps = [0 for i in range(n)]
    if (n == 0) or (arr[0] == 0):
        return float('inf')
    jumps[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        jumps[i] = float('inf')
        for j in range(i):
            if (i <= j + arr[j]) and (jumps[j] != float('inf')):
                jumps[i] = min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1)
                break
    return jumps[n-1]
```

**Chain of thought continued:**

5. **Inner Loop**: For each previous position j from 0 to i-1:
   - Check if position i is reachable from j (i ≤ j + arr[j])
   - Verify that j is reachable (jumps[j] ≠ infinity)
   - If both conditions are met, update jumps[i] to the minimum of its current value and jumps[j] + 1
   - Break early since we found the first valid jump path (greedy approach)

6. **Return Result**: After processing all positions, return jumps[n-1] which contains the minimum jumps to reach the last element

This function implements a dynamic programming solution to find the minimum number of jumps needed to go from the first to the last element of an array, where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position.
