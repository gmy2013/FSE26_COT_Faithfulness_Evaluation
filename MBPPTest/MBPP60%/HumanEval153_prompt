The following is chain of thought:
1. The function takes three lists `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` as input.
2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the common elements.
3. Use `zip` to iterate through corresponding elements of all three lists simultaneously.
4. For each set of corresponding elements `(m, n, o)` from the three lists:
   - Check if all three elements are equal (
