The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `len_log` takes a list of strings `list1` as input.
2. Initialize `min` to the length of the first element in `list1`.
3. Iterate through each element `i` in `list1`:
   - Compare the length of `i` with the current `min`.
   - If the length of `i` is less than `
