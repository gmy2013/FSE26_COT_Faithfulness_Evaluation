CodeGeneration:
ily by length, with sublists of the same length sorted lexicographically.

Here is the corrected function with the complete docstring:

```python
def sort_sublists(list1):
    """
    Sorts the sublists first by length and then lexicographically.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): A list containing sublists to be sorted.
        
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of sublists, primarily by length and secondarily lexicographically.
    """
    list1.sort()  # Sort lexicographically first
    list1.sort(key=len)  # Then sort by length (stable sort preserves lex order for same lengths)
    return list1
```

The function first sorts the sublists lexicographically, then sorts by length. Since Python's sort is stable when using the same key, and we're using different keys in separate operations, the final result will have sublists sorted primarily by length, with sublists of the same length maintaining their lexicographical order from the first sort.
