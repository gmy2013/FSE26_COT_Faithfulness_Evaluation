CodeGeneration:
below `num` and go downward, stopping at 1.

However, there are a few potential issues:
- The range includes 0, but 0 is not a positive integer and might not be considered a valid palindrome in some contexts.
- The function returns the first palindrome found, which is correct since we're going downward from the largest possible.
- It handles the case where no palindrome is found (though mathematically there should always be one, like 1).

Let me test with a few examples to verify:
- previous_palindrome(10) should return 9 (since 9 is palindrome).
- previous_palindrome(101) should return 99 (since 100 is not palindrome, 99 is).

The code seems correct for positive integers greater than 1. For num <= 1, it might not return correctly (e.g., num=1 would range from 0 to 1, but 0 is not palindrome, so it would return nothing? Actually, range(0,0,-1) is empty, so it returns None). We should handle edge cases.

Revised version with edge case handling:

```python
def previous_palindrome(num):
    """
    Returns the largest palindrome number strictly less than num.
    
    Args:
        num (int): A positive integer.
    
    Returns:
        int: The previous palindrome number, or None if not found.
    
    Examples:
        >>> previous_palindrome(10)
        9
        >>> previous_palindrome(101)
        99
        >>> previous_palindrome(1) is None
        True
    """
    if num <= 1:
        return None
    for x in range(num-1, 0, -1):
        if str(x) == str(x)[::-1]:
            return x
    return None
```

This handles the case where num <= 1 by returning None, since there is no positive palindrome less than 1. The function now explicitly returns None if no palindrome is found (though in practice, for num>1, there should always be one, like 1).
