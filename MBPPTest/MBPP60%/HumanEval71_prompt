The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_of_three` takes three numbers as input: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
2. The goal is to determine the largest (maximum) of these three numbers.
3. The function uses a series of conditional checks to compare the numbers:
   - First, it checks if `num1` is greater than or equal to both `num2` and `num3`. If true, it sets `lnum` to `num1`.
   - If the first condition is false, it checks if `num2` is greater than or equal to both `num1` and `num3`. If true, it sets `lnum` to `num2`.
   - If both previous
