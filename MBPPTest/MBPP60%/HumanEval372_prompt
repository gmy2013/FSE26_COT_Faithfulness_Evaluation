def left_rotate(s,d):
    tmp = s[d : ] + s[0 : d]
    return tmp  
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `left_rotate(s, d)` takes a string `s` and an integer `d`.
2. The goal is to rotate the string left by `d` positions.
3. To achieve this, we can split the string into two parts:
   - The substring starting from index `d` to the end.
   - The substring from the start to index `d`.
4. Concatenate these two substrings in reverse order (the part from `d` to end first, then the part from start to `d`).
5. The current implementation correctly does this:
   - `s[d:]` gets all character
