CodeGeneration:
acters are replaced with an empty string, effectively removing them.
3. The result is returned.

However, note that the pattern `[\W_]+` will remove all non-alphanumeric characters and underscores. This includes punctuation, whitespace, symbols, etc.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import re 

def remove_char(S):
    """Remove all non-alphanumeric characters and underscores from a string.
    
    Args:
        S (str): Input string
        
    Returns:
        str: String with all non-alphanumeric characters and underscores removed
    """
    result = re.sub('[\W_]+', '', S) 
    return result
```

Example usage:
```python
print(remove_char("Hello, World!"))  # Output: "HelloWorld"
print(remove_char("test_123@email.com"))  # Output: "test123emailcom"
print(remove_char("   spaces_and_symbols!@#"))  # Output: "spacesandsymbols"
```
