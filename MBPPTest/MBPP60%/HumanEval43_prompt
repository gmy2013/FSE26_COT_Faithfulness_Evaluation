def reverse_Array_Upto_K(input, k): 
  return (input[k-1::-1] + input[k:]) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose**: Reverse the first k elements of an array while keeping the remaining elements in their original order

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - `input`: The original array/list to be modified
   - `k`: The position up to which elements should be reversed (1-based index)

3. **Slicing Strategy**:
   - `input[k-1::-1]`: Gets elements from index (k-1) down to index 0 in reverse order
     - `k-1` converts from 1-based to 0-based indexing
     - `::-1` reverses the slice
   - `input[k:]`: Gets all elements from index k to the end (unchanged)

4. **Concatenation**: The reversed portion and unchanged portion are combined using `+`

5.
