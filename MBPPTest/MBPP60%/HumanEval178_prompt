The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of sublists (`list1`) as input.
2. Initialize an empty dictionary `result` to store the counts.
3. Iterate over each sublist `l` in `list1`:
   - Convert the sublist `l` to a tuple (since lists are unhashable and cannot be dictionary keys).
   - Use `setdefault` to get the list associated with the tuple key (creating an empty list if the key doesn't exist).
   - Append `1` to that list (each
