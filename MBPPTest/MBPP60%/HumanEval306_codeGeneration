CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the provided docstring and chain of thought. The function implements the "lucky number" sieve algorithm.

```python
def lucky_num(n):
    """
    Generate the first n lucky numbers using the lucky number sieve algorithm.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of lucky numbers to return
    
    Returns:
        list: List containing the first n lucky numbers
    """
    # Create initial list of odd numbers (starting from 1)
    List = list(range(-1, n*n+9, 2))
    i = 2
    
    # Sieve process: remove numbers at positions that are multiples of the current lucky number
    while i < len(List) and List[i:]:
        # Get the current lucky number to use for sieving
        sieve_num = List[i]
        
        # Calculate indices to remove (multiples of the current lucky number)
        indices_to_remove = []
        step = sieve_num
        start_index = sieve_num
        
        # Generate indices to remove (starting at position sieve_num, stepping by sieve_num)
        while start_index < len(List):
            indices_to_remove.append(start_index)
            start_index += step
        
        # Remove elements at the calculated indices (from highest to lowest to avoid index shifting issues)
        for idx in sorted(indices_to_remove, reverse=True):
            if idx < len(List):
                del List[idx]
        
        i += 1
    
    # Return the first n lucky numbers (excluding the initial -1)
    return List[1:n+1]
```

The function works as follows:
1. Creates an initial list of odd numbers starting from 1 (the -1 is included but will be removed later)
2. Uses a sieve process where it removes numbers at positions that are multiples of each successive lucky number
3. The first number (1) is always lucky, then it uses each subsequent number to sieve the list
4. Returns the first n numbers from the resulting list (excluding the initial -1)

This implements the classic lucky number algorithm where numbers are eliminated based on their position rather than their value.
