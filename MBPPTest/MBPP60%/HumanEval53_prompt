def rectangle_perimeter(l,b):
  perimeter=2*(l+b)
  return perimeter
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function is named `rectangle_perimeter` and takes two parameters: `l` (length) and `b` (breadth).
2. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is `2 * (length + breadth)`.
3. The function calculates this value and stores it in the variable `perimet
