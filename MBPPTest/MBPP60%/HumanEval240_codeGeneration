CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought analysis, the current implementation correctly counts inversions using a straightforward nested loop approach. Here's the complete function:

```python
def get_inv_count(arr, n):
    """
    Count the number of inversions in an array.
    
    An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) where i < j but arr[i] > arr[j].
    
    Args:
        arr: Input array/list
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of inversions in the array
    
    Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    
    Example:
        >>> get_inv_count([2, 4, 1, 3, 5], 5)
        3
        >>> get_inv_count([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5)
        0
    """
    inv_count = 0
    for i in range(n): 
        for j in range(i + 1, n): 
            if (arr[i] > arr[j]): 
                inv_count += 1
    return inv_count
```

The function correctly implements the inversion count algorithm using the straightforward approach. For better performance on large arrays, you could consider using a more efficient algorithm like merge sort inversion counting (O(n log n)), but this implementation works correctly for the given problem.
