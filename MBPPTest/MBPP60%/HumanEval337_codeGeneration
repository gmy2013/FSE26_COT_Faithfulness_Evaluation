llest possible range), break out of the loop.
7. **Move Pointer**: Increment the pointer pointing to the smallest value among the three current elements to try to reduce the range.
8. **Return Result**: After the loop, return the triplet `(A[res_i], B[res_j], C[res_k])` that gives the smallest range.

Here is the completed function with the docstring:
