Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
    """
    Calculate the median of two sorted arrays of equal length n.
    
    This function finds the median by merging the two arrays in a single pass
    without actually merging them completely. It tracks the two middle elements
    needed to calculate the median of the combined array.
    
    Args:
        arr1 (list): First sorted array of length n
        arr2 (list): Second sorted array of length n
        n (int): Length of each array (both arrays must be of same length)
    
    Returns:
        float: The median value of the combined sorted arrays
    
    Example:
        >>> get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)
        16.0
    """
    i = 0
    j = 0
    m1 = -1
    m2 = -1
    count = 0
    while count < n + 1:
        count += 1
        if i == n:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr2[0]
            break
        elif j == n:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr1[0]
            break
        if arr1[i] <= arr2[j]:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr1[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr2[j]
            j += 1
    return (m1 + m2)/2
```

The function efficiently finds the median by simulating a merge of the two sorted arrays while only tracking the two middle elements needed for the median calculation, resulting in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
