CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it creates a specific ordering of numbers from 1 to n where all odd numbers come first (in increasing order), followed by all even numbers (in increasing order), and returns the k-th element.

Here's a more Pythonic implementation of the same logic:

```python
def get_Number(n, k):
    """
    Returns the k-th number in a specific ordering of numbers from 1 to n.
    
    The ordering places all odd numbers first (in increasing order),
    followed by all even numbers (in increasing order).
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of numbers to include (1 to n)
        k (int): The position to return (1-indexed)
    
    Returns:
        int: The k-th number in the specific ordering
    
    Example:
        >>> get_Number(5, 1)
        1
        >>> get_Number(5, 3)
        5
        >>> get_Number(5, 4)
        2
    """
    # Count how many odd numbers are in range 1 to n
    num_odds = (n + 1) // 2
    
    if k <= num_odds:
        # k-th element is in the odd numbers section
        return 2 * k - 1
    else:
        # k-th element is in the even numbers section
        return 2 * (k - num_odds)
```

This implementation is more efficient as it:
1. Avoids building an entire array (O(1) space vs O(n) space)
2. Uses mathematical calculation instead of loops (O(1) time vs O(n) time)
3. Produces the same results as the original function

The logic is:
- If k is within the range of odd numbers, return the k-th odd number
- If k is beyond the odd numbers, return the (k - num_odds)-th even number
