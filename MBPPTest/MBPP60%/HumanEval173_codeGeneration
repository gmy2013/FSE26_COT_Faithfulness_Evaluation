CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and your chain of thought. The regex pattern appears to be cut off at the end, but I can see it's meant to validate email addresses with a specific format.

```python
import re 

regex = '^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w{2,3}$'

def check_email(email):
    """
    Validates an email address using a regex pattern.
    
    The regex pattern checks:
    - Starts with one or more alphanumeric characters (lowercase letters or digits)
    - Optional dot or underscore
    - Followed by one or more alphanumeric characters
    - Then an '@' symbol
    - Then one or more word characters (alphanumeric + underscore)
    - Then a dot
    - Ends with 2-3 word characters (typically the domain extension)
    
    Args:
        email (str): The email address to validate
        
    Returns:
        str: "Valid Email" if the email matches the pattern, "Invalid Email" otherwise
    """
    if(re.search(regex, email)): 
        return ("Valid Email") 
    else: 
        return ("Invalid Email")
```

Note: This regex pattern has some limitations for real-world email validation:
1. It only allows lowercase letters
2. It restricts domain extensions to 2-3 characters (missing newer TLDs like .info, .museum, etc.)
3. It doesn't handle quoted strings or special characters that are technically valid in emails

For production use, you might want to use a more comprehensive email validation library or a more robust regex pattern.
