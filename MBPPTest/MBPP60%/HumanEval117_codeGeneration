CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with an improved implementation:

```python
def alternate_elements(list1):
    """
    Returns a list containing every other element from the input list.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): The input list from which to select alternate elements
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...)
        
    Examples:
        >>> alternate_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        [1, 3, 5]
        >>> alternate_elements(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
        ['a', 'c']
        >>> alternate_elements([])
        []
    """
    result = []
    for item in list1[::2]:
        result.append(item)
    return result
```

The function works by:
1. Using list slicing `[::2]` to select every other element starting from index 0
2. Iterating through these selected elements and appending them to the result list
3. Returning the final list containing alternate elements

This implementation is efficient and handles edge cases like empty lists gracefully.
