min`, update `min` to that length.
4. Finally, return `min`.

However, note that the function name `len_log` might be intended to find the minimum length of strings in the list, but the name could be misleading. Let's assume it's correct.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def len_log(list1):
    min=len(list1[0])
    for i in list1:
        if len(i)<min:
            min=len(i)
    return min
```
