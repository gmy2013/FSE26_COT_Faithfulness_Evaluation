cube this value to get the total number of cubes in 3D space.

Here's the complete function with improved variable naming and comments:

```python
def No_of_cubes(N, K):
    """
    Calculate the number of cubes of side length K that can fit inside a larger cube of side length N.
    
    Args:
        N (int): Side length of the larger cube
        K (int): Side length of the smaller cubes
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of smaller cubes that can fit in the larger cube
    """
    positions_per_dimension = N - K + 1
    total_cubes = positions_per_dimension ** 3
    return total_cubes
```
