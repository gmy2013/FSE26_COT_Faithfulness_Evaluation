I'll complete the function based on the provided chain of thought. The function calculates the maximum average path value in an N×N cost matrix.

```python
M = 100
def maxAverageOfPath(cost, N): 
    dp = [[0 for i in range(N + 1)] for j in range(N + 1)] 
    dp[0][0] = cost[0][0] 
    for i in range(1, N): 
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + cost[i][0] 
    for j in range(1, N): 
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + cost[0][j] 
    for i in range(1, N): 
        for j in range(1, N): 
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], 
                        dp[i][j - 1]) + cost[i][j] 
    return dp[N - 1][N - 1] / (2 * N - 1)
```

The function works as follows:
1. **Initialization**: Creates a DP table with dimensions (N+1)×(N+1) initialized to zeros
2. **Base Case**: Sets the starting position `dp[0][0]` to the cost at position (0,0)
3. **First Column**: Fills the first column by accumulating costs from downward moves only
4. **First Row**: Fills the first row by accumulating costs from rightward moves only
5. **Main DP Loop**: For each cell (i,j), calculates the maximum path sum by choosing the better of coming from above (i-1,j) or from the left (i,j-1), then adds the current cell's cost
6. **Result**: Returns the maximum path sum divided by the path length (2N-1) to get the average

The function correctly implements the maximum average path calculation using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach.
