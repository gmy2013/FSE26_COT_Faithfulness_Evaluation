from collections import Counter
def add_dict(d1,d2):
   add_dict = Counter(d1) + Counter(d2)
   return add_dict
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `add_dict` takes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` as arguments.
2. The goal is to combine these dictionaries by adding the values for common keys.
3. We can use `Counter` from the `collections` module, which supports addition operations where values for common keys are summed.
4. Convert both dictionaries to `Counter` objects.
5. Add the two `Counter` objects together. This will create a new `Counter` where:
