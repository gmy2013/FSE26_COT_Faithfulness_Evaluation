The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `is_Perfect_Square` checks if an integer `n` is a perfect square.
2. It initializes `i` to 1 and enters a while loop that continues as long as `i*i <= n`.
3. Inside the loop, it checks two conditions:
   - `n % i == 0`: This ensures `i` is a divisor of `n`.
   - `n / i == i`: This checks if `n` divided by `i` equals `i`, meaning `n = i*i`.
4. If both conditions are true, it returns `True` (ind
