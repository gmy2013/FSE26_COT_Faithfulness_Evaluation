CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the provided docstring and chain of thought. Here's the implementation:

```python
def largest_subset(a, n):
    """
    Find the size of the largest subset such that for every pair of elements in the subset,
    one element is divisible by the other.
    
    Args:
        a (list): List of integers
        n (int): Length of the list
    
    Returns:
        int: Size of the largest subset
    """
    dp = [0 for i in range(n)]
    dp[n - 1] = 1
    
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        mxm = 0
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[j] % a[i] == 0 or a[i] % a[j] == 0:
                mxm = max(mxm, dp[j])
        dp[i] = 1 + mxm
    
    return max(dp)
```

This function uses dynamic programming to find the largest subset where for every pair of elements, one is divisible by the other. The algorithm works by:

1. Creating a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest valid subset starting at index `i`
2. Starting from the end of the array and working backwards
3. For each element, checking all subsequent elements to find those that form valid pairs (where one divides the other)
4. Taking the maximum chain length from valid subsequent elements
5. Returning the maximum value from the DP array as the result

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) and space complexity is O(n).
