The following is chain of thought:
1. Sort both input arrays `a` and `b` in non-decreasing order
2. Initialize a variable `sum` to accumulate the total minimum sum
3. Iterate through the first `n` elements of both sorted arrays
4. For each index `i`, calculate the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`
5. Add this absolute difference to the running sum
6. Return the final accumulated sum a
