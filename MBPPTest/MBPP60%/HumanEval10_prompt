def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
  res = max([sub[N] for sub in test_list])
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for implementing the max_of_nth function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function needs to find the maximum value from the Nth element of each sublist in a 2D list

2. **Input Validation**: 
   - Check if test_list is empty
   - Check if N is a valid index for all sublists
   - Handle edge cases where sublists might have different lengths

3. **Core Logic Implementation**:
   - Extract all Nth elements from each sublist using list comprehension
   - Use Python's built-in max() function to find the maximum value
   - Return the maximum value

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Add try-except block to handle IndexError when N exceeds sublist lengths
   - Cons
