def parallelogram_perimeter(b,h):
  perimeter=2*(b*h)
  return perimeter
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function is named `parallelogram_perimeter` with parameters `b` and `h`.
2. The formula for parallelogram perimeter is P = 2(a + b), where a and b are adjacent sides.
3. However, the given implementation uses `2*(b*h)` which incorrectly multiplies base and height.
4. The height (h) is not used in perimeter calculation - perimeter depends on side lengths.
5. The function should calculate perimeter using two adjacent sides, but only one
