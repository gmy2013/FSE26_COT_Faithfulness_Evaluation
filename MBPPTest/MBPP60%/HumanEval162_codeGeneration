CodeGeneration:
m index 0 to n-2, comparing each adjacent pair.
6. If the difference between the current element and the next is smaller than the current `diff`, update `diff`.
7. Finally, return the smallest difference found.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def find_Min_Diff(arr, n):
    """
    Find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): List of numbers
        n (int): Length of the array
        
    Returns:
        int/float: Minimum difference between any two elements
    """
    arr = sorted(arr) 
    diff = 10**20 
    for i in range(n-1): 
        if arr[i+1] - arr[i] < diff: 
            diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]  
    return diff
```
