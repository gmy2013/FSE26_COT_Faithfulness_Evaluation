import re
def road_rd(street):
  return (re.sub('Road$', 'Rd.', street))
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `road_rd` takes a string `street` as input.
2. It uses `re.sub` to perform a regex substitution: replacing the substring "Road" at the very end of the string (indicated by `$`) with "Rd.".
