CodeGeneration:
The provided code is already complete and correct. Here's the full implementation:

```python
def last(n):
   return n[-1]

def sort_list_last(tuples):
  return sorted(tuples, key=last)
```

This code will:
1. Define a helper function `last()` that returns the last element of any sequence
2. Define the main function `sort_list_last()` that sorts a list of tuples based on their last elements
3. Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function with the `last` function as the key parameter

Example usage:
```python
tuples_list = [(1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)]
sorted_tuples = sort_list_last(tuples_list)
print(sorted_tuples)  # Output: [(2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3)]
```

The code is working as intended and doesn't need any modifications.
