def min_difference(test_list):
  temp = [abs(b - a) for a, b in test_list]
  res = min(temp)
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the min_difference function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function calculates the minimum absolute difference between pairs of numbers in the input list
2. **Input Structure**: The input `test_list` contains pairs of numbers (likely as tuples or lists) where we need to compute differences
3. **Difference Calculation**: 
   - Iterate through each pair (a, b) in test_list
   - Calculate absolute difference using abs(b - a) for each pair
   - Store results in a temporary list
4. **Minimum Value Extraction**: Find the smallest value in the calculated differences list
