CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function with the completed docstring:

```python
import re

pattern = 'fox'
text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'

def find_literals(text, pattern):
    """
    Find the first occurrence of a literal pattern in text and return match details.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The text string to search within
        pattern (str): The literal pattern to search for
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing (pattern_string, start_index, end_index)
    """
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    s = match.start()
    e = match.end()
    return (match.re.pattern, s, e)
```

The function searches for the literal pattern in the text and returns a tuple with:
- The pattern string that was matched
- The start index of the match
- The end index of the match

For the given example, it would return: `('fox', 16, 19)`
