from itertools import combinations 
def find_combinations(test_list):
  res = [(b1 + a1, b2 + a2) for (a1, a2), (b1, b2) in combinations(test_list, 2)]
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the function step by step:

1. The function `find_combinations` takes a list `test_list` as input.
2. It uses `itertools.combinations` to generate all unique pairs of elements from `test_list`.
3. Each element in `test_list` is expected to be a tuple of two items (like (x, y)).
4. For each pair of tuples: ((a1, a2), (b1, b2)), it creates a new tuple where:
   - The first element is the sum of the first element of the second tuple and the first element of the first tuple (b1 + a1).
   - The second element is the sum of the second element of the second tuple and the second element of the first tuple (b2 + a2).
5. It collects all these resulting tuples into a list `res` and returns it.

However, note the order in the addition: (b1 + a1, b2 + a2). This means for each combination of two tuples, it adds the first tuple's elements
