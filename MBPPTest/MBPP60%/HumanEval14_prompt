def average_tuple(nums):
    result = [sum(x) / len(x) for x in zip(*nums)]
    return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `average_tuple` takes a list of tuples `nums` as input.
2. The goal is to compute the average of elements at each position across all tuples.
3. Use `zip(*nums)` to transpose the list of tuples, grouping elements by their positions.
4. For each group (position), calculate the average by summing the elements an
