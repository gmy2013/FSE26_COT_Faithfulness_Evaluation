The following is chain of thought:
We are given two functions: binomial_coeffi (which computes binomial coefficients recursively) and rencontres_number (which computes the Rencontres numbers recursively).
 The rencontres_number function has a docstring that is not provided, but we can infer its purpose from the code and common knowledge.

 However, the user asks to complete a function based on a docstring, but no docstring is provided in the input.
 Since the input only contains the code for two functions without a docstring for rencontres_number, we must assume that the function is already implemented as above.

 But note: the user says "Complete the following function based on the given docstring." but no docstring is given.
 This suggests there might be a misunderstanding. Alternatively, the user might want us to generate the code for rencontres_number with a proper docstring.

 Since the instruction is ambiguous, we will provide a complete version of rencontres_number with a docstring that matches the common definition.

 Common definition of Rencontres number D(n, m): number of permutations of n elements with exactly m fixed points.
 The recursive relations implemented in the code are standard:
   D(0,0) = 1
   D(1,0) = 0
   For m=0: D(n,0) = (n-1) * [ D(n-1,0) + D(n-2,0) ]   [Note: this is one of the recurrence relations for derangements]
   For general m: D(n,m) = C(n,m) * D(n-m, 0)

 However, note that the recurrence for m=0 in the code is:
   (n-1) * ( rencontres_number(n-1,0) + rencontres_number(n-2,0) )
 This is correct for derangements (m=0) and matches the known recurrence: D(n,0) = (n-1) [ D(n-1,0) + D(n-2,0) ]

 So the code is correct. But we should add a docstring.

 Since the user asks to complete the function based on the docstring, and no docstring is provided, we will write one.

 Let's write the function with a proper docstring.
 We'll also note that the recursive implementation is inefficient for large n due to repeated calculations, but that is acceptable for this exercise.

 Steps:
 1. Write a docstring for rencontres_number.
 2. The code is already g
