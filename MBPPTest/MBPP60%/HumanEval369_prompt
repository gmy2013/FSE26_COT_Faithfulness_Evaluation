def min_of_two( x, y ):
    if x < y:
        return x
    return y
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function is named `min_of_two` and takes two parameters, `x` and `y`.
2. The goal is to return the minimum of the two numbers.
3. The current implementation checks if `x` is less than `y`; if true, it returns `x`.
4. Otherwise, it returns `y`, which handles cases wh
