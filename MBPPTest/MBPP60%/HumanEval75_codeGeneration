eplacing all matches with an empty string, effectively removing them.
4. The result is returned.

However, note that the pattern `[\W_]+` matches any non-word character (which includes punctuation, whitespace, etc.) and underscores. This will remove all non-alphanumeric characters except underscores, but since underscores are also included in the character class, they will be removed as well.

Therefore, the function removes all non-alphanumeric characters (including underscores) from the input string.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
import re

def remove_extra_char(text1):
    """
    Remove all non-alphanumeric characters (including underscores) from the input string.
    
    Args:
        text1 (str): The input string from which to remove extra characters.
        
    Returns:
        str: The input string with all non-alphanumeric characters removed.
        
    Examples:
        >>> remove_extra_char("Hello, World!")
        'HelloWorld'
        >>> remove_extra_char("user_name123")
        'username123'
        >>> remove_extra_char("a!b@c#d$")
        'abcd'
    """
    pattern = re.compile('[\W_]+')
    return pattern.sub('', text1)
```
