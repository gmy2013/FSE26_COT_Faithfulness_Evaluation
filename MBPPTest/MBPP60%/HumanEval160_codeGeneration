CodeGeneration:
be calculated by `pi*d`, but the function is specifically for arcs, so returning `None` for a full circle might be intended to avoid confusion or indicate an invalid input for an arc).

4. The formula for arc length is (circumference) * (angle/360) = (pi * d) * (a/360).

Here is the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def arc_length(d, a):
    """
    Calculate the length of an arc given the diameter and angle.

    Parameters:
    d (float): Diameter of the circle.
    a (float): Angle of the arc in degrees.

    Returns:
    float: Length of the arc if angle is less than 360, None otherwise.
    """
    pi = 22 / 7
    if a >= 360:
        return None
    arclength = (pi * d) * (a / 360)
    return arclength
```
