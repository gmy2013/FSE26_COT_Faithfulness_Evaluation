CodeGeneration:
ent is indeed (2n choose n) = (2n)!/(n! * n!) = factorial(n+1, 2*n) / factorial(1, n).

However, the function name `sum_of_square(n)` is misleading because this actually computes the central binomial coefficient, not the sum of squares.

If you want to compute the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, the correct formula is:
sum_of_squares(n) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def factorial(start, end):
    res = 1
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        res *= i
    return res

def sum_of_square(n):
    # Formula for sum of squares: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
    return n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6
