The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the coin_change function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: This function solves the coin change problem using dynamic programming to count the number of ways to make change for amount 'n' using coins from set 'S' of size 'm'

2. **Table Initialization**: 
   - Create a 2D DP table with dimensions (n+1) Ã— m
   - Initialize first row (amount 0) to 1 since there's exactly 1 way to make change for 0 (using no coins)

3. **DP Table Population**:
   - Outer loop: Iterate through all amounts from 1 to n
   - Inner loop: Iterate through all coin denominations
   - For each cell table[i][j]:
     - x = number of ways using coin
