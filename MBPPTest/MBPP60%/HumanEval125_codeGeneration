CodeGeneration:
the product for each pair.
5. Convert the generator to a tuple and return it.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def multiply_elements(test_tup):
    """Multiply consecutive elements in a tuple and return the results as a tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): Input tuple containing numbers
        
    Returns:
        tuple: Tuple containing products of consecutive elements
        
    Examples:
        >>> multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))
        (5, 35, 56, 80)
        >>> multiply_elements((2, 4, 6))
        (8, 24)
        >>> multiply_elements((3,))
        ()
    """
    res = tuple(i * j for i, j in zip(test_tup, test_tup[1:]))
    return res
```
