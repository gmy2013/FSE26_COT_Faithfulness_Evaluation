CodeGeneration:
y the `key` from each group, which effectively removes consecutive duplicates while preserving the order of first occurrence.

Here is the complete function:

```python
from itertools import groupby

def consecutive_duplicates(nums):
    """Remove consecutive duplicates from a list.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of elements that may contain consecutive duplicates
        
    Returns:
        List with consecutive duplicates removed, preserving order of first occurrence
        
    Examples:
        >>> consecutive_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 2])
        [1, 2, 3, 2]
        >>> consecutive_duplicates(['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a'])
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']
    """
    return [key for key, group in groupby(nums)]
```
