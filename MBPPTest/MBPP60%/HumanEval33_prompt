The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `even_Power_Sum(n)` calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` even numbers.
2. The even numbers are generated as `2*i` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
3. For each even number `j = 2*i`, compute `j^4` (which is equivalent to `j*j*j*j`).
4. Accumulate thes
