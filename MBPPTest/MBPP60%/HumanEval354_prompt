def is_abundant(n):
    fctrsum = sum([fctr for fctr in range(1, n) if n % fctr == 0])
    return fctrsum > n
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the problem: An abundant number is one where the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number.
2. Identify the input: The function takes a positive integer `n`.
3. Plan the approach:
   - Find all proper divisors of `n` (numbers from 1 to n-1 that divide `n` evenly)
   - Calculate the sum of these divisors
   - Compare the sum to `n` and return True if sum > n, False otherwise
4. Implement t
