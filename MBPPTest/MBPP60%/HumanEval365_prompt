def remove_empty(tuple1): #L = [(), (), ('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d')]
   tuple1 = [t for t in tuple1 if t]
   return tuple1
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_empty` takes a tuple `tuple1` as input.
2. The goal is to remove any empty tuples or tuples containing only empty strings.
3. The provided list comprehension `[t for t in tuple1 if t]` filters out falsy elements.
   - In Python, an empty tuple `()` is falsy.
   - A tuple containing only an empty string `('',)` is also falsy because the empty string is falsy.
4. The filtered list is then returned.
5. However, note the input is a tuple but the function converts it to a list. The return type becomes a list, not a tuple.
6. The docstring example shows a list input `L`, but the function parameter is named `tuple1`. This suggests the input might be a tuple, but the example uses a list.
7. The function should handle both cases, but the return type is inconsistent with the input type if the input is a tuple.
8. To maintain consistency, if the input is a t
