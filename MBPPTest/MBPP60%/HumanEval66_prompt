def Check_Vow(string, vowels): 
    final = [each for each in string if each in vowels] 
    return(len(final)) 

The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the function purpose**: The function counts how many vowels (from the provided `vowels` list) are present in the input `string`.
2. **Analyze the current implementation**: 
   - Uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in `string`.
   - Checks if the character exists in the `vowels` list.
   - Collects matching characters into a list named `final`.
   - Returns the length of `fin
