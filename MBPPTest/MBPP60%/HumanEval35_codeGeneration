CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the chain of thought, here's the completed function:

```python
def Check_Solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if a equals c and return "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
    
    Parameters:
    a: First value to compare
    b: Second value (unused in comparison)
    c: Third value to compare with a
    
    Returns:
    str: "Yes" if a equals c, "No" otherwise
    """
    if (a == c):
        return ("Yes")
    else:
        return ("No")
```

The function compares `a` and `c` and returns "Yes" if they are equal, "No" otherwise. The parameter `b` is accepted but not used in the comparison logic.
