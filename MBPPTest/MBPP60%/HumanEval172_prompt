The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `occurance_substring` takes two arguments: `text` (the string to search in) and `pattern` (the regex pattern to search for).
2. It uses `re.finditer()` to find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the text, returning an iterator of match objects.
3. For the first match found (since it returns immediately), it gets the start index with `match.start()` and end index with `match.end()`.
4. It returns a tuple containing: th
