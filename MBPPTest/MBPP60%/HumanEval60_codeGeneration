CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, here's the complete function with the corrected recurrence relation:

```python
def max_sum_of_three_consecutive(arr, n):
    """
    Find the maximum sum of elements where no three consecutive elements are selected.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        Maximum sum with no three consecutive elements
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    sum = [0 for k in range(n)]
    
    if n >= 1:
        sum[0] = arr[0]
    
    if n >= 2:
        sum[1] = arr[0] + arr[1]
    
    if n >= 3:
        sum[2] = max(sum[1], max(arr[1] + arr[2], arr[0] + arr[2]))
    
    for i in range(3, n):
        sum[i] = max(sum[i-1],  # Don't include current element
                     sum[i-2] + arr[i],  # Include current, skip previous
                     arr[i] + arr[i-1] + sum[i-3])  # Include current and previous, skip one before
    
    return sum[n-1]
```

The function implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the "no three consecutive elements" problem by considering all valid cases at each position and building the solution incrementally.
