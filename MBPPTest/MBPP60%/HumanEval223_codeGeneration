CodeGeneration:
This function has a critical issue: modifying a list while iterating over it can cause elements to be skipped. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def remove_even(l):
    """
    Remove all even numbers from the given list.
    
    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing only odd numbers from the original list
        
    Example:
        >>> remove_even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        [1, 3, 5]
    """
    return [x for x in l if x % 2 != 0]
```

The key improvements:
1. Uses list comprehension instead of modifying the list during iteration
2. Returns a new list rather than modifying the original in place
3. Uses `x % 2 != 0` (odd check) instead of removing even numbers
4. Avoids the issue of skipping elements during iteration

Alternative implementation if you want to modify the original list:
```python
def remove_even(l):
    """
    Remove all even numbers from the given list in-place.
    
    Args:
        l (list): A list of integers (will be modified)
        
    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even numbers removed
    """
    i = 0
    while i < len(l):
        if l[i] % 2 == 0:
            l.pop(i)
        else:
            i += 1
    return l
```
