CodeGeneration:
.start()`).
4. If no number is found, the function does not explicitly return anything, which would result in returning `None`.

However, the current implementation returns immediately on the first match. This is correct as per the requirement to find the first number's position.

Let me write the complete function with proper indentation and docstring:

```python
import re

def num_position(text):
    """
    Return the starting position of the first number in the given text.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to search for numbers.
        
    Returns:
        int or None: The starting index of the first number found, 
                     or None if no number is present.
    """
    for m in re.finditer(r"\d+", text):
        return m.start()
    return None
```

The function now:
1. Uses a raw string for the regex pattern (r"\d+") to avoid potential issues
2. Explicitly returns None if no numbers are found (after the loop)
3. Has proper docstring documentation
4. Maintains the correct behavior of finding the first number's starting position
