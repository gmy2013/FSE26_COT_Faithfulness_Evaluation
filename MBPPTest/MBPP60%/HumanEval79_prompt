def increasing_trend(nums):
    if (sorted(nums)== nums):
        return True
    else:
        return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `increasing_trend` checks if a list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The current implementation uses `sorted(nums) == nums` to compare the original list with its sorted version.
3. This approach works correctly for determining if the list
