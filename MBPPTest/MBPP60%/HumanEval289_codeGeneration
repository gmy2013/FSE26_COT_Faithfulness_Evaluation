CodeGeneration:
urns n when arrays are identical up to index n-1 (implying the extra element is at the end of the larger array)

5. **Assumptions**:
   - One array has exactly one extra element compared to the other
   - Arrays are identical except for one position
   - n represents the size of the smaller array

Here's the complete function:

```python
def find_Extra(arr1,arr2,n) : 
    """
    Find the index where two arrays first differ.
    
    Parameters:
    arr1 (list): First input array
    arr2 (list): Second input array
    n (int): Length of the smaller array
    
    Returns:
    int: Index where arrays first differ, or n if identical up to index n-1
    """
    for i in range(0, n) : 
        if (arr1[i] != arr2[i]) : 
            return i 
    return n
```
