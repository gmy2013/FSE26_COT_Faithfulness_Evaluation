def check_identical(test_list1, test_list2):
  res = test_list1 == test_list2
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for implementing the `check_identical` function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function needs to compare two lists and return whether they are identical
2. **Input Parameters**: Two lists (`test_list1` and `test_list2`) to be compared
3. **Comparison Logic**: Use Python's built-in `==` operator which compares lists element-wise and considers both content and order
4. **Return Value**: Return the boolean result of the comparison directly
5. **Implemen
