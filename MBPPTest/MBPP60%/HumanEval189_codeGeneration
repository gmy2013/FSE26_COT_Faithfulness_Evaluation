CodeGeneration:
e if all elements satisfy the condition, False otherwise.

The provided function is already correct and complete. Here's the full function with proper formatting:

```python
def even_position(nums):
    """Check if every element at index i has the same parity (even/odd) as its index.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements satisfy nums[i] % 2 == i % 2, False otherwise
    """
    return all(nums[i] % 2 == i % 2 for i in range(len(nums)))
```

The function correctly implements the specified behavior by checking if each element's parity (even/odd) matches its index position's parity.
