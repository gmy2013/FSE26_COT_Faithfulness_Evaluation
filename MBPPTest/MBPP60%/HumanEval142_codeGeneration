CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function implementation, it appears to be performing a rotation operation where:
- The last `m` elements are moved to the front
- The remaining elements (excluding the last `n` elements) follow

However, this implementation seems inconsistent for a typical rotation operation. For a standard right rotation by `k` positions, we would expect:
`result = list1[-k:] + list1[:-k]`

Here's a revised implementation with proper documentation that clarifies the intended behavior:

```python
def rotate_right(list1, m, n):
    """
    Rotates the list to the right by moving the last m elements to the front,
    then appends the remaining elements excluding the last n elements.
    
    Args:
        list1: The input list to be rotated
        m: Number of elements from the end to move to the front
        n: Number of elements from the end to exclude from the remaining portion
    
    Returns:
        A new list with the rotated elements
        
    Example:
        >>> rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2, 1)
        [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]  # Last 2 elements moved to front, excluding last 1 element from remainder
    """
    result = list1[-(m):] + list1[:-(n)]
    return result
```

If you intended a standard right rotation by `k` positions, the function would be:

```python
def rotate_right(list1, k):
    """
    Rotates the list to the right by k positions.
    
    Args:
        list1: The input list to be rotated
        k: Number of positions to rotate right
    
    Returns:
        A new list rotated right by k positions
        
    Example:
        >>> rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)
        [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
    """
    k = k % len(list1)  # Handle rotations larger than list length
    return list1[-k:] + list1[:-k]
```
