from collections import Counter
def count_variable(a,b,c,d):
  c = Counter(p=a, q=b, r=c, s=d)
  return list(c.elements())
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_variable` takes four arguments: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
2. It creates a `Counter` object with keys 'p', 'q', 'r', 's' mapped to the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` respectively.
3. The `Counter` object `c` will count the occurrences, but here it's being used to store these specific key-value pairs.
4. `c.elements()` returns an iterator over elements repeating each as many times as its count. Since the counts are the integer values passed in, this will repeat each key ('p', 'q', 'r', 's') a number of times equal to its co
