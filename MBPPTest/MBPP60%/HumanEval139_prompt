def tuple_to_dict(test_tup):

  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
2. The goal is to convert the tuple into a dictionary by grouping elements in pairs (key-value).
3. The comprehension iterates over indices from 0 to the length of the tuple, stepping by 2.
4. For each index `idx`, it slices the tuple from `idx` to `idx+2` to get a key-value pair.
5. The `dict()` constructor builds a d
