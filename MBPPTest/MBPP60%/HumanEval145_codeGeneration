CodeGeneration:
e has area πr², and angles ≥360° are not valid for a sector).
4. **Sector Area Calculation**: The area of the sector is calculated using the formula (π * r²) * (a/360).
5. **Return Result**: The calculated sector area is returned.

However, note that the function returns `None` for angles >=360, which might be intended to handle invalid inputs. But in some contexts, angles >=360 could be normalized (e.g., by taking modulo 360), but the docstring doesn't specify that. Since the docstring is not provided, we assume the current behavior is as intended.

Let me write the code with the same logic, but with improved comments and style:

```python
def sector_area(r, a):
    """
    Calculate the area of a sector given the radius and angle in degrees.
    
    Args:
        r (float): Radius of the circle.
        a (float): Angle of the sector in degrees.
    
    Returns:
        float: Area of the sector if angle is less than 360, else None.
    """
    pi = 22 / 7  # Approximation of pi
    if a >= 360:
        return None  # Invalid angle for a sector
    sector_area = (pi * r ** 2) * (a / 360)
    return sector_area
```

This code maintains the original functionality while adding a docstring for clarity.
