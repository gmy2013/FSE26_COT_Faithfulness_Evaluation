function correctly calculates the area using the standard formula for a rhombus.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def rombus_area(p, q):
    """
    Calculate the area of a rhombus given its two diagonals.
    
    Parameters:
    p (float): Length of the first diagonal
    q (float): Length of the second diagonal
    
    Returns:
    float: Area of the rhombus calculated as (p * q) / 2
    
    Example:
    >>> rombus_area(8, 6)
    24.0
    >>> rombus_area(10.5, 7.2)
    37.8
    """
    area = (p * q) / 2
    return area
```
