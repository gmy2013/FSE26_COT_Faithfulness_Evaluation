def adjac(ele, sub = []): 
  if not ele: 
     yield sub 
  else: 
     yield from [idx for j in range(ele[0] - 1, ele[0] + 2) 
                for idx in adjac(ele[1:], sub + [j])] 
def get_coordinates(test_tup):
  res = list(adjac(test_tup))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze this code step by step:

1. **Function `adjac(ele, sub=[])`**:
   - This is a recursive generator function that generates all possible coordinate sequences
   - Base case: if `ele` is empty, yield the current `sub` list
   - Recursive case: for each element in `ele`, generate values in the range `[current-1, current+1]` (3 possible values)
   - Recursively call `adjac` with the remaining elements and the current value appended to `sub`

2. **Function `get_coordinates(test_tup)`**:
   - Calls `adjac(test_tup)` to generate all coordinate sequences
   - Converts the generator to a list and returns it

3. **What it does**:
   - Given a tuple of coordinates, generates all possible adjacent coordinate sequences
   - For each position in the input tuple, generates coordinates that are Â±1 from the original
