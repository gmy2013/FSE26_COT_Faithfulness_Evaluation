CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function using integer division:

```python
def same_Length(A, B):
    """
    Check if two integers A and B have the same number of digits.
    
    Args:
        A (int): First integer
        B (int): Second integer
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if A and B have the same number of digits, False otherwise
    """
    while (A > 0 and B > 0):
        A = A // 10
        B = B // 10
    if (A == 0 and B == 0):
        return True
    return False
```

The key changes made:
1. Replaced `/` with `//` for integer division to avoid floating point issues
2. Removed the semicolons (not needed in Python)
3. Added a proper docstring explaining the function's purpose and parameters
4. The logic remains the same: both numbers are reduced by one digit at a time until at least one reaches zero, then we check if both reached zero simultaneously
