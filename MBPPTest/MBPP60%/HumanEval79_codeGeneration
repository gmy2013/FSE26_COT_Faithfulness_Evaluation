CodeGeneration:
is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def increasing_trend(nums):
    """
    Check if a list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): A list of numbers (integers or floats)
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, False otherwise
    
    Examples:
        >>> increasing_trend([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        True
        >>> increasing_trend([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
        False
        >>> increasing_trend([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])
        False
        >>> increasing_trend([1, 1, 2, 2, 3])
        True
    """
    if (sorted(nums)== nums):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The implementation correctly compares the original list with its sorted version to determine if the list is already in non-decreasing order. This approach handles both strictly increasing sequences and sequences with duplicate values (non-decreasing order).
