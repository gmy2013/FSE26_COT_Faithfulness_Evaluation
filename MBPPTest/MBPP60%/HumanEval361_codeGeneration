CodeGeneration:
I see the issue. The `sum_Natural` function is incorrectly implemented (missing division by 2), and the approach in `sum_Even` needs adjustment. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def sum_Natural(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of natural numbers to sum
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of first n natural numbers
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

def sum_Even(l, r):
    """
    Calculate the sum of even numbers between l and r (inclusive).
    
    Args:
        l (int): Lower bound (inclusive)
        r (int): Upper bound (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of even numbers in range [l, r]
    """
    # Sum of evens up to r: 2 * sum_Natural(r//2)
    # Sum of evens up to l-1: 2 * sum_Natural((l-1)//2)
    return 2 * (sum_Natural(r // 2) - sum_Natural((l - 1) // 2))
```

The key corrections:
1. Fixed `sum_Natural` to use the correct formula `n*(n+1)//2`
2. Changed `sum_Even` to multiply by 2 since the sum of even numbers up to n is `2 * sum_Natural(n//2)`
3. Used integer division `//` for proper floor division

This implementation correctly calculates the sum of even numbers between l and r inclusive using the mathematical relationship between natural numbers and even numbers.
