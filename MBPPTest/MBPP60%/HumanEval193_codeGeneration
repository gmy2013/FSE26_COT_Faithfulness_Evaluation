CodeGeneration:
requires the match to start at the beginning (due to 'a') and end at the end (due to '$'), which effectively checks if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import re
def text_starta_endb(text):
    patterns = 'a.*?b$'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```
