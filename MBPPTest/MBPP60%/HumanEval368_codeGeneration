om index 1 onward).
   - If false, append the current tuple `sub` as a new list to `res`.
4. After processing all tuples, convert each list in `res` back to a tuple.
5. Return the list of merged tuples.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def join_tuples(test_list):
    """
    Join consecutive tuples in the list that have the same first element.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): List of tuples to process
        
    Returns:
        list: List of merged tuples where consecutive tuples with same first element are combined
        
    Example:
        >>> join_tuples([(5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 10)])
        [(5, 6, 7), (6, 8, 9), (7, 10)]
    """
    res = []
    for sub in test_list:
        if res and res[-1][0] == sub[0]:
            res[-1].extend(sub[1:])
        else:
            res.append([ele for ele in sub])
    res = list(map(tuple, res))
    return res
