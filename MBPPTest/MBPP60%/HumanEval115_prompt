def rombus_perimeter(a):
  perimeter=4*a
  return perimeter
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function name is `rombus_perimeter` (note: likely a typo for "rhombus" but we'll use the given name)
2. The function takes one parameter `a`, which represents the side length of the rhombus
3. The perimeter of a rhombus is calculated as 4 times the side length (since all sides are equal)
4. The calcula
