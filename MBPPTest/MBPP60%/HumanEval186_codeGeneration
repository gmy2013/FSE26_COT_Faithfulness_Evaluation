CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function, I can see it's designed to find the pattern "abbb" in text using regex. However, there's an issue with the current implementation - the pattern uses a non-greedy quantifier `?` which is unnecessary for an exact count like `{3}`.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
import re
def text_match_three(text):
    patterns = 'ab{3}'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

The change is simple: I removed the unnecessary `?` from the pattern `'ab{3}?'` to make it `'ab{3}'`. Since `{3}` specifies an exact count of 3 occurrences, the non-greedy modifier `?` is redundant and doesn't affect the matching behavior. Both patterns will match the substring "abbb" exactly the same way.
