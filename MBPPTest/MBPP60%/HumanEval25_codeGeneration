CodeGeneration:
The function name "triangle_area" is misleading since it returns r² (area of a square), not the area of a triangle. Based on the docstring requirement, here's the corrected implementation for calculating the area of an equilateral triangle:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(r):
    """
    Calculate the area of an equilateral triangle with side length r.
    
    Args:
        r (float): Length of one side of the equilateral triangle
    
    Returns:
        float: Area of the equilateral triangle, or -1 if r is negative
    """
    if r < 0:
        return -1
    return (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * r * r
```

This implementation:
1. Checks for negative input and returns -1 as error indicator
2. Uses the correct formula for equilateral triangle area: (√3/4) × r²
3. Includes proper documentation explaining the function's purpose
4. Uses the math module for the square root calculation
