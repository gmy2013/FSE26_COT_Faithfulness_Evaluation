CodeGeneration:
n to return both even and odd lists, and consider renaming it to be more descriptive.

Here's the improved function:

```python
def split_even_odd(input_list):
    """
    Splits a list of integers into even and odd numbers.
    
    Args:
        input_list (list): A list of integers to be split
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists - (even_numbers, odd_numbers)
    """
    even_numbers = []
    odd_numbers = []
    
    for num in input_list:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(num)
        else:
            odd_numbers.append(num)
            
    return (even_numbers, odd_numbers)
```

This implementation:
1. Uses a more descriptive function name `split_even_odd`
2. Returns both even and odd numbers as separate lists in a tuple
3. Includes proper docstring documentation
4. Uses more descriptive variable names
5. Handles the complete splitting operation as suggested by the function name
