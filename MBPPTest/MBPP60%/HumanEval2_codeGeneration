**: While the removal index is within bounds, remove the element at that index, then update the removal index by adding `first_ludic - 1` (since the list shrinks after each removal).
7. **Increment index**: Move to the next index and repeat.

Here is the complete function with detailed comments:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    """
    Generate a list of Ludic numbers up to n.
    
    Ludic numbers are obtained by a process similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes:
    1. Start with the list of integers from 1 to n.
    2. Start with the first number (1) and keep it.
    3. For each subsequent number at position 'index', keep it and remove every 
       (number at index)-th number after it in the list.
    4. Repeat until no more numbers can be removed.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Upper limit to generate Ludic numbers up to.
    
    Returns:
        list: List of Ludic numbers <= n.
    """
    # Initialize the list with all integers from 1 to n
    ludics = list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    # Start from index 1 (second element, since first element 1 is always kept)
    index = 1
    
    # Process the list until we reach the end
    while index < len(ludics):
        # Get the current Ludic number at this index
        current_ludic = ludics[index]
        
        # Calculate the first index to remove: index + current_ludic
        remove_index = index + current_ludic
        
        # Remove every current_ludic-th element after the current position
        while remove_index < len(ludics):
            # Remove the element at remove_index
            del ludics[remove_index]
            
            # Update remove_index: jump ahead by current_ludic - 1 positions
            # (subtract 1 because the list just got shorter by 1 element)
            remove_index += current_ludic - 1
        
        # Move to the next index in the modified list
        index += 1
    
    return ludics
