CodeGeneration:
la by multiplying `s` (number of sides) by `l` (side length).
4. The function returns the calculated perimeter.
5. The implementation is correct and complete based on the mathematical formula.

No additional code is needed as the function is already correctly implemented.

```python
from math import tan, pi

def perimeter_polygon(s, l):
    perimeter = s * l
    return perimeter
```
