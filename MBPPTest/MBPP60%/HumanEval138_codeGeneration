digits. If not, we may need to increment until we find the correct `m`.

Let me adjust the function to ensure correctness by checking the actual number of digits of the triangular number for the computed `m` and adjusting if necessary.

```python
import math

def find_Index(n):
    """
    Find the smallest integer m such that the triangular number T_m = m(m+1)/2 has at least n digits.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The minimum number of digits required.
    
    Returns:
    int: The smallest m such that T_m has at least n digits.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 1  # T1 = 1 has 1 digit
    
    # Approximate m using m >= sqrt(2 * 10^(n-1))
    approx_m = math.isqrt(2 * (10 ** (n - 1)))
    # Start from the approximation and check if T_m has at least n digits
    m = approx_m
    while True:
        T_m = m * (m + 1) // 2
        if T_m >= 10 ** (n - 1):  # This condition ensures at least n digits
            return m
        m += 1
