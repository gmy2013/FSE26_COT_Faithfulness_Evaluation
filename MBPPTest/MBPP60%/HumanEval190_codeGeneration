CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought and the provided function, I can see that the function is designed to remove nested tuples from the input tuple. However, I notice that the function doesn't handle nested tuples recursively - it only removes immediate tuple elements. If you want to flatten all nested tuples recursively, here's an improved version:

```python
def remove_nested(test_tup):
    """
    Remove all nested tuples from the input tuple, returning a flattened tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): Input tuple that may contain nested tuples
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A new tuple with all elements from the original tuple,
               but with any nested tuples flattened (removed as containers)
    
    Examples:
        >>> remove_nested((1, (2, 3), 4))
        (1, 2, 3, 4)
        >>> remove_nested((1, 2, 3))
        (1, 2, 3)
        >>> remove_nested((1, (2, (3, 4)), 5))
        (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    """
    def flatten(tup):
        result = []
        for item in tup:
            if isinstance(item, tuple):
                result.extend(flatten(item))
            else:
                result.append(item)
        return result
    
    return tuple(flatten(test_tup))
```

If you want to keep the original behavior (only removing immediate tuple elements without recursive flattening), here's the corrected version:

```python
def remove_nested(test_tup):
    """
    Remove immediate nested tuples from the input tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): Input tuple that may contain nested tuples
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A new tuple with all non-tuple elements from the original tuple
    
    Examples:
        >>> remove_nested((1, (2, 3), 4))
        (1, 4)
        >>> remove_nested((1, 2, 3))
        (1, 2, 3)
        >>> remove_nested((1, (2, (3, 4)), 5))
        (1, 5)
    """
    res = tuple()
    for ele in test_tup:
        if not isinstance(ele, tuple):
            res = res + (ele,)
    return res
```

The main improvements are:
1. Removed unused `count` variable from enumerate
2. Added proper docstring with examples
3. Provided both recursive and non-recursive versions based on the intended behavior
