CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and chain of thought provided:

```python
def return_sum(dict):
    """
    Returns the sum of all values in the given dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dict: A dictionary with numeric values
        
    Returns:
        The sum of all values in the dictionary
    """
    sum = 0
    for i in dict.values():
        sum = sum + i
    return sum
```

The function takes a dictionary as input, iterates through all the values using `dict.values()`, adds each value to a running total, and returns the final sum of all values in the dictionary.
