def sorted_models(models):
 sorted_models = sorted(models, key = lambda x: x['color'])
 return sorted_models
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sorted_models` takes a list of dictionaries `models` as input.
2. Each dictionary in the list represents a model with various attributes, including 'color'.
3. The goal is to sort the list of dictionaries based on the value of the 'color' key in each dictionary.
4. Use Python's built-in `sorted` function, which returns a new sorted list.
5. Specify the `key` parameter as a lambda function that extracts the 'color' value from each dictionary.
6.
