ern in the text.
4. If found, it returns 'Found a match!'; otherwise, 'Not matched!'.

However, note that the pattern `\Bz\B` might not be entirely correct for matching 'z' strictly in the middle of a word. Let me explain:

- `\B` matches a position that is not a word boundary.
- So `\Bz\B` matches a 'z' that has non-word boundaries on both sides, meaning it is neither at the start nor the end of a word.

But this pattern will also match 'z' in the middle of a sequence of non-word characters, which might not be intended. For example, in "a!z!b", it would match the 'z' because it is surrounded by non-word boundaries (non-alphanumeric characters).

If the goal is to match 'z' only when it is inside a word (i.e., surrounded by word characters), a better pattern might be `\wz\w` or `[a-zA-Z]z[a-zA-Z]`. However, the original pattern `\Bz\B` is also acceptable if we want to match 'z' not at word boundaries, even in non-word contexts.

Given the docstring says "middle of a word", it might be better to use `\wz\w` to ensure it is surrounded by word characters. But since the function is already implemented with `\Bz\B`, we'll keep it as is unless specified otherwise.

Let me write the code accordingly.

```python
import re
def text_match_wordz_middle(text):
    patterns = r'\Bz\B'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

Note: I added the raw string prefix `r` to the pattern to avoid any unintended escape sequences. This is a good practice in regex patterns.
