def check(string): 
  if len(set(string).intersection("AEIOUaeiou"))>=5: 
    return ('accepted')

    return ("not accepted")

2. It checks if the number of unique vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) in the string is at least 5.
3. It does this by:
   - Converting the string to a set of unique characters
   - Finding the intersect
