28 or 29 days). The logic is correct but could be made more concise.

Here's an improved version with better readability:

```python
def check_monthnumber_number(monthnum3):
    """Check if a given month number has exactly 30 days.
    
    Args:
        monthnum3 (int): Month number (1-12)
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if month has 30 days (April, June, September, November), False otherwise
    """
    return monthnum3 in {4, 6, 9, 11}
```

The function uses a set for membership testing which is more efficient and readable than multiple OR conditions.
