def No_of_cubes(N,K):
    No = 0
    No = (N - K + 1)
    No = pow(No, 3)
    return No
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function calculates the number of cubes of side length K that can fit inside a larger cube of side length N.
2. The number of positions along one dimension is (N - K + 1).
3. Since it's a 3D cube, we need to
