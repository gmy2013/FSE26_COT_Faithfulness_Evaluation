CodeGeneration:
I notice that your chain of thought is incomplete (it cuts off at "reduces the problem size w"). However, I can see that the function you provided is already a correct implementation of the recursive GCD algorithm using the Euclidean method.

Let me complete the function with proper formatting and add a docstring:

```python
def recur_gcd(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using recursion.
    
    This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers
    by recursively applying the property: GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b)
    
    Args:
        a (int): First integer
        b (int): Second integer
    
    Returns:
        int: The greatest common divisor of a and b
    
    Examples:
        >>> recur_gcd(48, 18)
        6
        >>> recur_gcd(17, 13)
        1
        >>> recur_gcd(0, 5)
        5
    """
    low = min(a, b)
    high = max(a, b)
    
    if low == 0:
        return high
    elif low == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return recur_gcd(low, high % low)
```

Your implementation is correct and follows the Euclidean algorithm properly. The function:
1. Identifies the smaller and larger numbers
2. Handles base cases (when one number is 0 or 1)
3. Recursively applies the GCD property: GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b)

The algorithm will continue reducing the problem size until it reaches one of the base cases, ensuring termination and correctness.
