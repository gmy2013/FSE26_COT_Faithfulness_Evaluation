I'll complete the function based on the docstring and chain of thought provided. The function appears to be solving the "Minimum Platforms" problem where we need to find the minimum number of platforms required at a railway station given arrival and departure times.

```python
def find_platform(arr, dep, n):
    """
    Finds the minimum number of platforms required at a railway station
    such that no train waits.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of arrival times
        dep: List of departure times
        n: Number of trains/entries
    
    Returns:
        Minimum number of platforms required
    """
    arr.sort() 
    dep.sort() 
    plat_needed = 1
    result = 1
    i = 1
    j = 0
    
    while (i < n and j < n): 
        if (arr[i] <= dep[j]):           
            plat_needed += 1
            i += 1
        elif (arr[i] > dep[j]):           
            plat_needed -= 1
            j += 1
        
        if (plat_needed > result):  
            result = plat_needed           
    
    return result
```

The function works by:
1. Sorting both arrival and departure arrays to process events in chronological order
2. Using two pointers to track current arrivals and departures
3. When a train arrives before the current departure, we need an additional platform
4. When a train departs before the next arrival, we can free up a platform
5. Keeping track of the maximum number of platforms needed at any point in time

This is an efficient O(n log n) solution due to the sorting step, with O(n) time for the actual platform counting.
