def is_upper(string):
  return (string.upper())
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function is named `is_upper` and takes a string parameter.
2. The docstring is missing, but the function should check if the string is uppercase.
3. The current implementation returns `string.upper()`, which converts the string to uppercase but does not check if it was already uppercase.
4. To check if the string is uppercase, we should compare the original string to its uppercase version.
5. The correct implementation should return `True` if the string is already uppercase, `False` otherwise.
6. We can achieve this by returning `string == string.upper()`.
