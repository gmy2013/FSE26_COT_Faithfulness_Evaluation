from collections import Counter 
def max_char(str1):
    temp = Counter(str1) 
    max_char = max(temp, key = temp.get)
    return max_char
The following is chain of thought:
1. Import Counter from collections to count character frequencies efficiently.
2. Define function max_char that takes string str1 as input.
3. Create Counter object temp to count occurrences of each character in str1.
4. Find the character with maximum frequency using max() with key=temp.get.
