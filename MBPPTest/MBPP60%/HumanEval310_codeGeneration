) to get the two smallest numbers (which could be negative).
5. Compare the product of the three largest numbers and the product of the largest number with the two smallest numbers, and return the maximum of these two.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def maximum_product(nums):
    """
    Find the maximum product of three numbers from the list.

    Args:
        nums: List of integers

    Returns:
        Maximum product of any three numbers from the list

    Examples:
        >>> maximum_product([1, 2, 3])
        6
        >>> maximum_product([-10, -10, 5, 2])
        500
        >>> maximum_product([-1, -2, -3, -4])
        -6
    """
    import heapq
    a, b = heapq.nlargest(3, nums), heapq.nsmallest(2, nums)
    return max(a[0] * a[1] * a[2], a[0] * b[0] * b[1])
```
