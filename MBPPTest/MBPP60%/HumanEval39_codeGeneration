CodeGeneration:
egex substitution to each, and return the list of processed strings.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import re
def remove_parenthesis(items):
    """Remove text within parentheses from each string in the list.

    Args:
        items (list): List of strings that may contain parentheses.

    Returns:
        list: List of strings with text within parentheses removed.
    """
    result = []
    for item in items:
        result.append(re.sub(r" ?\([^)]+\)", "", item))
    return result
```
