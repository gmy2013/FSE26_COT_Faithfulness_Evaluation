 return total
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function calculates the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers using a mathematical formula.

2. **Formula Identification**: The formula used is the known mathematical identity for the sum of squares: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

3. **Variable Initialization**: The variable 'total' is initialized to 0, though this is immediately overwritten in the next line.

4. **Calculation Process**: The formula is applied directly to compute the sum
