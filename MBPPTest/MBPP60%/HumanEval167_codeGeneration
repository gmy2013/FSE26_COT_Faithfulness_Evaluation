CodeGeneration:
h time a set bit is cleared.
6. After the loop, check if `parity` (the count of set bits) is odd by checking if `parity % 2 == 1`.
7. Return `True` if odd, `False` otherwise.

The function is already complete and correct. Here is the full code for reference:

```python
def check_Odd_Parity(x):
    parity = 0
    while (x != 0):
        x = x & (x - 1)
        parity += 1
    if (parity % 2 == 1):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
