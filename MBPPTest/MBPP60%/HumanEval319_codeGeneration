CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis, here's an improved implementation that returns the actual list instead of a string representation:

```python
def remove_tuple(test_list):
    """
    Remove tuples from test_list where all elements are None.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): List of tuples to filter
        
    Returns:
        list: List with tuples containing only None values removed
        
    Example:
        >>> remove_tuple([(1, 2), (None, None), (3, None)])
        [(1, 2), (3, None)]
        >>> remove_tuple([(None, None), (None, None)])
        []
    """
    return [sub for sub in test_list if not all(ele is None for ele in sub)]
```

Key improvements:
1. Returns the actual list instead of string representation
2. Uses `is None` instead of `== None` (more Pythonic for None comparisons)
3. Added comprehensive docstring with examples
4. Handles edge cases like empty lists or lists with only None tuples

The function now properly filters out tuples where all elements are `None` while preserving the original data structure.
