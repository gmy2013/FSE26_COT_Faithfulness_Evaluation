CodeGeneration:
correct. Here's the function with an appropriate docstring added:

```python
def count_list(input_list):
    """Return the number of elements in the input list.
    
    Args:
        input_list (list): The list whose elements should be counted
        
    Returns:
        int: The number of elements in the input list
    """
    return len(input_list)
```

The function is already correctly implemented to count the number of elements in a list using Python's built-in `len()` function.
