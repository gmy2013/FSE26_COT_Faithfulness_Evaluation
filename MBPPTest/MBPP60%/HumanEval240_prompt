def get_inv_count(arr, n):

The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Count inversions in an array (pairs where i < j but arr[i] > arr[j])
2. Analyze the current implementation: Uses nested loops with O(nÂ²) time complexity
3. Check parameters: arr (input array), n (length of array)
4. Verify logic: Outer loop iterates through each element, inner loop compares with all subsequent elements
5. Confirm correct
