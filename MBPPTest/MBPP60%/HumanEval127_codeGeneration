CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided function and chain of thought, here's the complete implementation:

```python
def sum_list(lst1, lst2):
    """
    Sums corresponding elements from two lists of numbers.
    
    This function takes two lists of numbers and returns a new list where
    each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the input lists.
    
    Args:
        lst1 (list): First list of numbers
        lst2 (list): Second list of numbers (must be same length as lst1)
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing element-wise sums
    
    Raises:
        IndexError: If the lists have different lengths
    
    Example:
        >>> sum_list([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
        [5, 7, 9]
    """
    res_list = [lst1[i] + lst2[i] for i in range(len(lst1))]
    return res_list
```

The function performs element-wise addition of two lists, assuming they have the same length. If the lists have different lengths, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access elements beyond the length of the shorter list.
