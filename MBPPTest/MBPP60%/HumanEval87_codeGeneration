CodeGeneration:
eturns this magnitude.

The provided function is already complete and correct. Here's the full code with the docstring:

```python
import cmath

def len_complex(a, b):
    """
    Calculate the magnitude (length) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts.
    
    Parameters:
    a (float): The real part of the complex number
    b (float): The imaginary part of the complex number
    
    Returns:
    float: The magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the complex number
    """
    cn = complex(a, b)
    length = abs(cn)
    return length
```

This function will correctly compute the magnitude of a complex number using the formula √(a² + b²) through Python's built-in `abs()` function for complex numbers.
