CodeGeneration:
After computing the factorial without trailing zeros, extract the first digit by repeatedly dividing by 10 until the number is less than 10, then return that digit.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import math

def first_Digit(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fact = fact * i
        while fact % 10 == 0:
            fact = fact // 10
    while fact >= 10:
        fact = fact // 10
    return fact
```

Note: I changed `int(fact / 10)` to `fact // 10` for integer division, which is more efficient and clearer for integer operations. The function returns the first digit of the factorial of `n` after removing any trailing zeros during computation.
