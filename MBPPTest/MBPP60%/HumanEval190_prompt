def remove_nested(test_tup):
  res = tuple()
  for count, ele in enumerate(test_tup):
    if not isinstance(ele, tuple):
      res = res + (ele, )
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze the function step by step:

1. The function takes a tuple `test_tup` as input
2. It initializes an empty tuple `res` to store the result
3. It iterates through each element in `test_tup` using `enumerate` (though the index `count` is not used)
4. For each element, it checks if it's NOT a tuple using `isinstance(ele, tuple)`
5. If the element is not a tuple, it adds it to the result tuple
6. Finally, it returns the result tuple

The function removes all nested tuples from the inpu
