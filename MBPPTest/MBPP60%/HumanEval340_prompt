The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_elim` takes a parameter `num`, which is expected to be an iterable (likely a list or tuple).
2. Initialize a counter `count_elim` to 0 to keep track of the number of elements processed.
3. Iterate over each element `n` in the input `num`.
4. For each element, check if it is an instance of `tuple` using `isinstance(n, tuple)`.
5. If an element is a tuple, immediately break out of the loop.
6. If the element is no
