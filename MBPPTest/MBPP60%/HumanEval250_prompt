def Sum_of_Inverse_Divisors(N,Sum): 
    ans = float(Sum)*1.0 /float(N);  
    return round(ans,2); 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function takes two parameters: N and Sum.
2. It calculates the value of Sum divided by N as a floating point number.
3. The result is rounded to two decimal places.
4. The
