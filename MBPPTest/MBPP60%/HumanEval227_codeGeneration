CodeGeneration:
increment the special character counter
6. Return a tuple containing the three counts

Here's the complete function:

```python
def count_alpha_dig_spl(string):
    """
    Count the number of alphabetic characters, digits, and special characters in a string.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The input string to analyze
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing (alphabets_count, digits_count, special_characters_count)
    """
    alphabets = digits = special = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i].isalpha():
            alphabets += 1
        elif string[i].isdigit():
            digits += 1
        else:
            special += 1
    return (alphabets, digits, special)
```

The function works by:
1. Initializing three counters to zero
2. Iterating through each character in the string
3. Using string methods `isalpha()` and `isdigit()` to categorize each character
4. Returning the counts as a tuple

Example usage:
```python
result = count_alpha_dig_spl("Hello123!@#")
print(result)  # Output: (5, 3, 3)
```
