CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought analysis, the current implementation doesn't properly check for solutions to the linear equation `a*x + b = c`. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def Check_Solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if the linear equation a*x + b = c has a solution.
    
    Args:
        a (float): Coefficient of x
        b (float): Constant term
        c (float): Right-hand side constant
    
    Returns:
        str: "Yes" if the equation has at least one solution, "No" otherwise
    """
    if a != 0:
        # Unique solution exists (a ≠ 0)
        return "Yes"
    elif b == c:
        # Infinite solutions (a = 0 and b = c)
        return "Yes"
    else:
        # No solution (a = 0 and b ≠ c)
        return "No"
```

This implementation correctly handles all cases:
- When `a ≠ 0`: The equation has exactly one solution
- When `a = 0` and `b = c`: The equation is an identity (0 = 0), so it has infinitely many solutions
- When `a = 0` and `b ≠ c`: The equation is inconsistent (b = c where b ≠ c), so it has no solution
