The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `find_Sum` takes an array `arr` and integer `n` (presumably the length of `arr`). It aims to compute the sum of distinct elements in the array.

2. **Initial Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order using `arr.sort()`. This groups duplicate elements together, facilitating the identification of distinct elements.

3. **Sum Initialization**: The variable `sum` is initialized to the first element of the sorted array (`arr[0]`). This ensures the first distinct element is included in the sum.

4. **Iteration Through Array**: A loop runs from index `0` to `n-2` (i.e., `range(0, n-1)`). This allows comparison of each element with its immediate successor.

5. **Distinct Element Check**: For each index `i`, check if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i+1]`. If they are different, it indicates `arr[i+1]` is a
