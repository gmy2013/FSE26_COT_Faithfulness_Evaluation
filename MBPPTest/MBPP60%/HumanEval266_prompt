The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the min_Num function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function aims to determine the minimum number to return based on the count of odd numbers in the array.

2. **Initialize Counter**: Start by initializing a variable `odd` to 0 to count the number of odd elements in the array.

3. **Iterate Through Array**: Loop through each element in the array using a for-loop with index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Check for Odd Numbers**: For each element `arr[i]`, check if it is odd by using the modulo operation `(arr[i] % 2)`. If true, increment the `
