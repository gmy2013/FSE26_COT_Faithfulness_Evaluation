Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def remove_length(test_str, K):
    """
    Remove all words from the string that have length equal to K.
    
    Args:
        test_str (str): The input string containing words
        K (int): The length of words to remove
    
    Returns:
        str: The string with words of length K removed
    
    Examples:
        >>> remove_length("hello world this is a test", 5)
        'world this is a'
        >>> remove_length("python programming is fun", 3)
        'python programming fun'
    """
    temp = test_str.split()
    res = [ele for ele in temp if len(ele) != K]
    res = ' '.join(res)
    return (res)
```

The function works by:
1. Splitting the input string into individual words
2. Filtering out words whose length equals K using a list comprehension
3. Joining the remaining words back into a string
4. Returning the result

The function handles cases where words are separated by spaces and preserves the original word order while removing only the words that match the specified length.
