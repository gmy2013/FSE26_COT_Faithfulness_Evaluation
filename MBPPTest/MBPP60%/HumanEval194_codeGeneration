CodeGeneration:
The function you provided is already correct and efficient for finding the `n` cheapest items based on the 'price' key. Here's the complete implementation:

```python
import heapq

def cheap_items(items, n):
    """
    Return the n cheapest items from a list of dictionaries based on the 'price' key.
    
    Args:
        items (list): List of dictionaries where each dictionary has a 'price' key
        n (int): Number of cheapest items to return
    
    Returns:
        list: List of n dictionaries with the lowest prices
    
    Example:
        >>> items = [{'name': 'item1', 'price': 10}, 
        ...          {'name': 'item2', 'price': 5}, 
        ...          {'name': 'item3', 'price': 15}]
        >>> cheap_items(items, 2)
        [{'name': 'item2', 'price': 5}, {'name': 'item1', 'price': 10}]
    """
    cheap_items = heapq.nsmallest(n, items, key=lambda s: s['price'])
    return cheap_items
```

The function uses `heapq.nsmallest()` which is efficient for this purpose, especially when `n` is small compared to the total number of items. The lambda function extracts the 'price' value from each dictionary for comparison.
