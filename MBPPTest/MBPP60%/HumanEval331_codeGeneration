CodeGeneration:
nt is not in `temp`, append it to `temp`.
5. Return the `temp` list containing unique elements.

The function is already complete and correctly implements the described logic to remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order of first occurrences.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def remove_duplic_list(l):
    temp = []
    for x in l:
        if x not in temp:
            temp.append(x)
    return temp
```
