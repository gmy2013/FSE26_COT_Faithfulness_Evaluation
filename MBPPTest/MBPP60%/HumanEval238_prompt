The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `sort_tuple` sorts a tuple of tuples based on the first element of each inner tuple using the bubble sort algorithm.

2. **Input Analysis**: 
   - Parameter: `tup` - a tuple containing inner tuples (or other indexable elements)
   - Assumption: Each inner element must be indexable and have at least one element at index 0

3. **Algorithm Selection**: 
   - Uses bubble sort algorithm (O(nÂ²) complexity)
   - Sorts in ascending order based on the first element of each inner tuple

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Get length of input tuple `n = len(tup)`
   - Outer loop: iterate `n` times (number of passes needed)
   - Inner loop: compare adjacent elements, reducing range each pass (bubble sort optimization)
   - Comparison: `tup[j][0] > tup[j + 1][0]` compares first elements
   - Swap: if comparison is true, swap positions using tuple unpacking
   - Return: modified tuple (note: tuples are immutable, but this modifies the original reference)
