def check(arr,n): 
    g = 0 
    for i in range(1,n): 
        if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > 0 and g == 1): 
            return False
        if (arr[i] - arr[i] < 0): 
            g = 1
    return True
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze this function step by step:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function appears to check if an array is non-decreasing initially and then non-increasing (a "mountain" shape)

2. **Variable Analysis**:
   - `g = 0` - This is a flag to track if we've encountered the peak (transition from increasing to decreasing)
   - The loop starts from index 1 to n-1

3. **Logic Issues**:
   - Line 4: `if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] > 0 and g == 1)` - This correctly detects if we're still increasing after the peak
   - Line 5: `if (arr[i] - arr[i] < 0)` - This is problematic: `arr[i] - arr[i]` always equals 0, never < 0
   - The condition should be `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < 0` to detect decreasing sequence

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single element arrays
   - Strictly increasing arrays (no decreasing part)
   - Strictly decreasing arrays (no increasing part)
   - Arrays with equal consecutive elements

5. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The flag `g` should be set when we detect the first decrease (transition from increasing to decreasing)
   - The condition should check `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` to detect decreases

The function aims to verify if the array forms a valid mountain shape.
```python
def check(arr, n):
    """
    Check if array forms a valid mountain shape.
    
    A valid mountain array:
    1. Starts with strictly increasing sequence
    2. Reaches a peak
