def even_position(nums):
	return all(nums[i]%2==i%2 for i in range(len(nums)))
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Check if every element at index i has the same parity (even/odd) as its index.
2. Analyze the return statement: Uses `all()` with a generator expression that iterates through indices.
3. For each index i: Check if `nums[i] % 2 == i % 2` (both even or both odd).
4. The `all()` function returns Tru
