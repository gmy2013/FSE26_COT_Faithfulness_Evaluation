def remove_kth_element(list1, L):
    return  list1[:L-1] + list1[L:]
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_kth_element` takes two parameters: `list1` (a list) and `L` (an integer position).

3. The solution uses list slicing:
   - `list1[:L-1]` gets all elements from the start up to (but not including) the element at index L-1 (which is the L-th element in 1-indexi
