def get_key(dict): 
    list = [] 
    for key in dict.keys(): 
        list.append(key)           
    return list
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `get_key` takes a dictionary `dict` as input.
2. It initializes an empty list called `list`.
3. It iterates over each key in the dictionary using `dict.keys()`.
4. In each iteration, it appends the current key to the list.
5. After processing all keys, it returns the list containing all key
