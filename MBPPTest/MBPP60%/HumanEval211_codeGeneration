CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the provided function, here's the complete implementation:

```python
import re

def road_rd(street):
    """
    Replace 'Road' at the end of a street name with 'Rd.' abbreviation.
    
    Args:
        street (str): The street name to be processed
        
    Returns:
        str: The street name with 'Road' replaced by 'Rd.' if it appears at the end
    """
    return re.sub('Road$', 'Rd.', street)
```

This function:
- Takes a street name string as input
- Uses regex to find "Road" at the end of the string (indicated by the `$` anchor)
- Replaces it with the abbreviated form "Rd."
- Returns the modified string
- Leaves strings unchanged if they don't end with "Road"

Example usage:
```python
print(road_rd("Main Road"))      # "Main Rd."
print(road_rd("Broadway Road"))  # "Broadway Rd."
print(road_rd("Park Avenue"))    # "Park Avenue" (unchanged)
```
