CodeGeneration:
occurrence of the sublist adds a 1 to the count list).

4. After processing all sublists, iterate over the dictionary items:
   - For each key (tuple) and value (list of 1s), replace the value with the sum of the list (which gives the count of occurrences).

5. Return the dictionary with tuples as keys and their counts as values.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    """
    Write a function to count the number of unique sublists within a given list.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): A list of sublists (each sublist can contain any elements).
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are tuples (the unique sublists converted to tuples for hashability) 
              and values are integers (count of occurrences of that sublist in list1).
    
    Example:
        Input: [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]]
        Output: {(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}
    """
    result = {}
    for l in list1:
        result.setdefault(tuple(l), list()).append(1)
    for a, b in result.items():
        result[a] = sum(b)
    return result
```
