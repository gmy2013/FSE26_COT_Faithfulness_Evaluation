def sort_dict_item(test_dict):
  res = {key: test_dict[key] for key in sorted(test_dict.keys(), key = lambda ele: ele[1] * ele[0])}
  return  (res) 

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sort_dict_item` takes a dictionary `test_dict` as input.
2. The goal is to return a new dictionary with keys sorted by a custom key function.
3. The custom key function sorts the keys by the product of their elements (assuming keys are tuples with at least two elements).
4. The dictionary comprehension creates a new dictionary by iterating over keys sorted using `sorted(test_dict.keys(), key=lambda ele: ele[1] * ele[0])`.
5. The sorted keys are used to access the
