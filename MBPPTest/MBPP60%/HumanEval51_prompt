def matrix_to_list(test_list):
  temp = [ele for sub in test_list for ele in sub]
  res = list(zip(*temp))
  return (str(res))
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function takes `test_list` as input, which is a matrix (list of lists).
2. The first line flattens the matrix into a 1D list using nested list comprehension.
3. The second line uses `zip(*temp)` to transpose the flattened list, effectively grouping elements by thei
