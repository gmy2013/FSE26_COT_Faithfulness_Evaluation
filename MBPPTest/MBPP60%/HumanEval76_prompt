def validity_triangle(a,b,c):
 total = a + b + c
 if total == 180:
    return True
 else:
    return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `validity_triangle` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the angles of a triangle.
2. The function calculates the sum of these angles and stores it in the variable `total`.
3. It checks if the sum equals 180 degrees, which is the required sum for a valid triangle in Euclidean geometry.
4. If the sum is exactly 180, it returns `True`, indicating the angles f
