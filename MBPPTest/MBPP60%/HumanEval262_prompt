The following is chain of thought:
1. Sort the input array to group consecutive numbers.
2. Remove duplicates by creating a new list with only unique elements.
3. Initialize count to track current consecutive sequence length and ans to track maximum.
4. Iterate through the unique elements:
   - If current element is exactly one mo
