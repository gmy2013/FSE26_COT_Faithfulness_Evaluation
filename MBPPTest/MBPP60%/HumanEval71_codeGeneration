CodeGeneration:
conditions are false, it defaults to setting `lnum` to `num3`, as `num3` must be the largest in that case.
4. Finally, the function returns the value stored in `lnum`, which is the maximum of the three numbers.

This implementation correctly handles all cases, including when two or all three numbers are equal.

Here is the complete function code:

```python
def max_of_three(num1, num2, num3):
    if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
        lnum = num1
    elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
        lnum = num2
    else:
        lnum = num3
    return lnum
```
