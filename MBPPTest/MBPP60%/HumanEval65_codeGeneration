CodeGeneration:
Based on your chain of thought analysis, I can see that the function is already correctly implemented. The logic properly counts occurrences of a character in a string using:

- A counter variable initialized to 0
- Iteration through string indices
- Character comparison at each position
- Counter incrementation on matches
- Return of the final count

Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def count_char(string, char):
    """
    Count the number of occurrences of a character in a string.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The string to search through
        char (str): The character to count
    
    Returns:
        int: The number of times the character appears in the string
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == char:
            count = count + 1
    return count
```

The function works correctly and efficiently counts character occurrences. An alternative Pythonic approach could use `string.count(char)`, but the current implementation is perfectly valid and demonstrates the underlying logic clearly.
