The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `all_Characters_Same` checks if all characters in a string `s` are identical.
2. It first gets the length `n` of the string.
3. If the string is empty (`n=0`), the loop doesn't run, and it returns `True` (since there are no differing characters).
4. For non-empty strings, it iterates from index 1 to the end.
5. For each index `i`, it compares `s[i]` with the first character `s[0]`.
6. If any character differs
