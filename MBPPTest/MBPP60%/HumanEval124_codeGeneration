CodeGeneration:
uantifier `?` ensures that the shortest possible substring between quotes is captured, which is important for cases with multiple quoted substrings in the same text.

Here is the complete function:

```python
import re

def extract_quotation(text1):
    """Extract all substrings from text1 that are enclosed in double quotes.
    
    Args:
        text1 (str): The input string from which to extract quoted substrings.
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of all substrings found within double quotes in text1.
        Returns an empty list if no quoted substrings are found.
    """
    return re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', text1)
```
