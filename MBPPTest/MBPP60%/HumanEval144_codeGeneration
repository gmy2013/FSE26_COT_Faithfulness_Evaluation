CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected implementation based on the chain of thought:

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    """
    Return a list of numbers in the range [startnum, endnum] where each number
    is divisible by every one of its digits (excluding 0 digits).
    
    Args:
        startnum (int): The starting number of the range (inclusive)
        endnum (int): The ending number of the range (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        list: List of numbers divisible by all their non-zero digits
    """
    result = []
    for n in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
        digits = str(n)
        divisible_by_all = True
        
        for digit_char in digits:
            digit = int(digit_char)
            if digit == 0:
                continue  # Skip division by zero
            if n % digit != 0:
                divisible_by_all = False
                break
        
        if divisible_by_all:
            result.append(n)
    
    return result
```

Alternative one-liner version (more concise but less readable):

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    """
    Return a list of numbers in the range [startnum, endnum] where each number
    is divisible by every one of its digits (excluding 0 digits).
    """
    return [n for n in range(startnum, endnum + 1) 
            if all(n % int(d) == 0 for d in str(n) if d != '0')]
```

The key improvements:
1. Properly handles division by zero by skipping 0 digits
2. Uses `all()` for more readable logic (all digits must satisfy the condition)
3. Clearer variable naming and structure
4. Includes proper docstring documentation
