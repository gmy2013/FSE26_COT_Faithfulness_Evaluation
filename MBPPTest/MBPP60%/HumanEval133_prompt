def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr,n):
    ans = 0
    res = 0
    i = n - 1
    while (i >= 0):
        incr = arr[i]*(1 + res)
        ans += incr
        res = incr
        i -= 1
    return (ans)
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Initialize variables**: 
   - `ans` to accumulate the total sum of all subarray products
   - `res` to store the cumulative product contribution from the right side
   - `i` as an index starting from the end of the array

2. **Process array from right to left**:
   - For each element `arr[i]`, calculate `incr = arr[i] * (1 + res)`
   - This represents the sum of products of all subarrays ending at position `i`

3. **Update results**:
   - Add `incr` to the total sum `ans`
