CodeGeneration:
I see you've already provided a complete implementation of the `check_smaller` function. Based on your chain of thought, the function correctly implements the logic to check if every element in `test_tup1` is greater than the corresponding element in `test_tup2`.

Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def check_smaller(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """Check if every element in test_tup1 is greater than the corresponding element in test_tup2.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1 (tuple): First tuple to compare
        test_tup2 (tuple): Second tuple to compare
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements in test_tup1 > corresponding elements in test_tup2, False otherwise
    """
    res = all(x > y for x, y in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
    return res
```

The implementation is correct and follows your chain of thought:
1. Uses `zip()` to pair elements from both tuples by position
2. Uses a generator expression with `all()` to check if all pairs satisfy the condition `x > y`
3. Returns the boolean result

The function will work correctly as long as both tuples have the same length. If they have different lengths, `zip()` will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple.
