CodeGeneration:
The function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with a docstring:

```python
def div_of_nums(nums, m, n):
    """
    Return numbers from the list that are divisible by both m and n.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of numbers to filter
        m (int): First divisor
        n (int): Second divisor
    
    Returns:
        list: Numbers divisible by both m and n
    
    Example:
        >>> div_of_nums([10, 15, 20, 30], 5, 2)
        [10, 20, 30]
    """
    result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 and x % n == 0), nums)) 
    return result
```

The function correctly:
- Takes a list of numbers and two divisors
- Uses `filter()` with a lambda function to check divisibility by both m and n
- Converts the filter object to a list
- Returns the filtered results

The implementation is efficient and meets the requirements specified in the docstring.
