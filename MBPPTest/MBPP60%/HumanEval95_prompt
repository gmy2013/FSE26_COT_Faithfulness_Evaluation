def zip_list(list1,list2):  
 result = list(map(list.__add__, list1, list2)) 
 return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `zip_list` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input.
2. The goal is to combine corresponding elements from both lists by concatenating them.
3. The current implementation uses `map` with `list.__add__` to add corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.
4. However, this approach assumes both `list1` and `list2` contain only list elements, which may not be the case.
5. The function should work with any elements (numbers, strings, etc.), not just lists.
6. The correct approach is to use `zip` to pair elements and then concatenate each pair.
7. For example, if `list1 = [1, 2]` and `list2 = [3, 4]`, the result should be `[1, 3, 2, 4]`.
8. We can achieve this by using a list comprehension that iterates through zipped pairs and creates a new list by extending with each pair.
9. Alternatively, we can use `zip` and then flatten the result.
10. The corre
