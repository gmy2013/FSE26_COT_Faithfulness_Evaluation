CodeGeneration:
ifying a list while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior, as the iteration index may skip elements after removals. To safely remove negative numbers, we should iterate over a copy of the list or use list comprehension.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def remove_negs(num_list):
    """Remove all negative numbers from the input list.
    
    Args:
        num_list: List of numbers (may contain integers and floats)
    
    Returns:
        List with all negative numbers removed. Original list is modified in-place.
    """
    # Iterate over a copy to avoid modification during iteration issues
    for item in num_list[:]:
        if item < 0:
            num_list.remove(item)
    return num_list
```

Alternative implementation using list comprehension (creates a new list instead of modifying in-place):

```python
def remove_negs(num_list):
    """Remove all negative numbers from the input list.
    
    Args:
        num_list: List of numbers (may contain integers and floats)
    
    Returns:
        New list with all negative numbers removed.
    """
    return [item for item in num_list if item >= 0]
```

The first version maintains the original behavior of modifying the list in-place, while the second version creates and returns a new list without negative numbers.
