However, note that the variable `test_tup` is reassigned to the new tuple, but this doesn't affect the original tuple outside the function (as tuples are immutable and passed by value). The function returns the new empty tuple as expected.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def clear_tuple(test_tup):
    temp = list(test_tup)
    temp.clear()
    test_tup = tuple(temp)
    return test_tup
```
