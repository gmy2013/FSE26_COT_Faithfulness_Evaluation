def area_tetrahedron(side):
  area = math.sqrt(3)*(side*side)
  return area
The following is chain of thought:
The function calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron. A regular tetrahedron has 4 equilateral triangular faces. The area of one equilateral triangle is (√3/4)*side². Since there are 4 faces, the to
