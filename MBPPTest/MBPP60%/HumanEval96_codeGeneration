Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def count_even(array_nums):
    """
    Count the number of even numbers in the given array.
    
    Args:
        array_nums (list): A list of numbers (integers or floats)
    
    Returns:
        int: The count of even numbers in the array
    """
    count_even = len(list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) , array_nums)))
    return count_even
```

The function works as described in your chain of thought:
1. Takes a list of numbers as input
2. Filters the list to keep only even numbers (where `x % 2 == 0`)
3. Converts the filtered iterator to a list
4. Returns the length of that list, which represents the count of even numbers
