    return round(math.ceil(a / n) * n, digits)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `round_up` takes two arguments: `a` (the number to round) and `digits` (the number of decimal places to round up to).
2. Compute `n` as `10**-digits`, which represents the precision level (e.g., for `digits=2`, `n=0.01`).
3. Divide `a` by `n` to scale the number up so that the decimal portion becomes an integer part.
4. Apply `math.ceil` to this scaled value to round it up to the
