sing Euclidean algorithm)
   - Then use the GCD to compute LCM using the formula
   - Handle edge cases (zero values, negative numbers)

Here's the optimized implementation:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers."""
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return abs(a)

def lcm(x, y):
    """Calculate the Least Common Multiple of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x (int): First integer
        y (int): Second integer
        
    Returns:
        int: Least common multiple of x and y
        
    Examples:
        >>> lcm(12, 18)
        36
        >>> lcm(5, 7)
        35
        >>> lcm(0, 5)
        0
    """
    if x == 0 or y == 0:
        return 0
    return abs(x * y) // gcd(x, y)
```

The optimized version:
- Uses the mathematical relationship between LCM and GCD
- Handles zero values properly (LCM of 0 and any number is 0)
- Works with negative numbers by using absolute values
- Is much more efficient (O(log(min(x, y))) instead of O(max(x, y)))
- Uses integer division (//) to ensure the result is an integer
