CodeGeneration:
t from the list of words.
5. Use the most_common method to get the n most common words.
6. Return the result as a list.

Here is the complete function:

```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def n_common_words(text, n):
    """Return the n most common words in the given text.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input text to analyze
        n (int): Number of most common words to return
        
    Returns:
        list: List of tuples containing (word, count) for the n most common words
    """
    words = re.findall('\w+', text.lower())
    n_common_words = Counter(words).most_common(n)
    return n_common_words
```

I've added `.lower()` to make the function case-insensitive, which is typically desired for word frequency analysis. The function will return the n most common words along with their counts as a list of tuples.
