CodeGeneration:
I notice the function implementation is already provided, but there are a few issues to address:

1. The function doesn't handle n = 0 (which should return 0)
2. The function doesn't handle negative numbers
3. The parentheses are unbalanced in the return statement

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (n >= 0)
    
    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

Key improvements:
- Added proper docstring with parameter description, return type, and exception handling
- Added validation for negative inputs
- Added base case for n = 0 (returns 0)
- Fixed the unbalanced parentheses in the return statement
- Used elif for better readability

Note: While this recursive implementation is mathematically correct, it has exponential time complexity O(2^n). For practical use with larger values of n, a memoized or iterative approach would be more efficient.
