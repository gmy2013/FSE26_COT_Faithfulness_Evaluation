def remove_list_range(list1, leftrange, rigthrange):
   result = [i for i in list1 if (min(i)>=leftrange and max(i)<=rigthrange)]
   return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Remove sublists where min or max values fall outside [leftrange, rightrange]
2. Analyze the current implementation: Uses list comprehension with min(i) and max(i) checks
3. Identify issues: 
   - Variable name "rigthrange" has a typo (should be "rightrange")
   - The logic correctly filters sublists where all elements are within the range
4. Consider edge cases: 
   - Empty
