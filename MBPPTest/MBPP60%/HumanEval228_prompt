The following is chain of thought:
1. The function uses Counter to count frequencies of elements in the input list
2. It sorts the frequency values in descending order
3. It selects the second largest frequency value (index 1 in the sorted list)
4. It iterates through the Counter items to find the first key that matches this second largest frequency
5. Returns that key immediately upon finding
