from itertools import groupby
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(list1):
    return [list(group) for key, group in groupby(list1)]
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `pack_consecutive_duplicates` takes a list `list1` as input.
2. It uses `itertools.groupby` to group consecutive identical elements together.
3. `groupby` returns an iterator producing tuples `(key, group)` where `key` is the unique element and `group` is an iterator of consecutive duplicates.
4. For each `(key, group)`
