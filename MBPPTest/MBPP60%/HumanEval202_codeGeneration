CodeGeneration:
icating `n` is a perfect square).
5. If the loop completes without finding such an `i`, it returns `False`.

However, note that the condition `(n % i == 0) and (n / i == i)` can be simplified to just `i * i == n` since if `i*i == n`, then `n % i` is always 0 (unless `i=0`, but `i` starts at 1 and increases). Also, using integer arithmetic might be more efficient and avoid floating-point issues.

Let me rewrite the function for clarity and efficiency:

```python
def is_Perfect_Square(n):
    """
    Check if a number is a perfect square.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to check.
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n is a perfect square, False otherwise.
    """
    if n < 0:
        return False
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if i * i == n:
            return True
        i += 1
    return False
```

This version:
1. Handles negative numbers correctly (negative numbers cannot be perfect squares)
2. Uses direct comparison `i*i == n` instead of the more complex condition
3. Maintains the same time complexity O(âˆšn)
4. Is more readable and efficient

For even better performance with large numbers, you could use binary search or mathematical properties, but this maintains the original approach while improving clarity.
