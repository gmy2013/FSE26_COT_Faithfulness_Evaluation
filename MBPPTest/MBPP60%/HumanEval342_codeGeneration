CodeGeneration:
I notice that the chain of thought is incomplete, but I can see the function implementation. The function appears to work correctly for merging two sorted lists, but there's a variable naming issue that could cause confusion.

Here's the corrected version with improved variable naming:

```python
from heapq import merge

def combine_lists(num1, num2):
    """Combine two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
    
    Args:
        num1 (list): First sorted list
        num2 (list): Second sorted list
        
    Returns:
        list: Combined sorted list containing all elements from both input lists
    """
    combined_list = list(merge(num1, num2))
    return combined_list
```

The key improvement is changing the variable name from `combine_lists` (which shadows the function name) to `combined_list` to avoid confusion and potential bugs. The function correctly uses `heapq.merge()` which is efficient for merging sorted lists.
