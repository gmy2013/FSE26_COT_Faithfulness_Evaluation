CodeGeneration:
re 'b's), but it affects how the matching is performed (minimal matching). For the purpose of `re.search()`, which just checks for any match, the non-greedy quantifier doesn't change the result - it will still match any string that contains 'a'.

6. Therefore, the function will return 'Found a match!' for any text containing at least one 'a', and 'Not matched!' for texts without any 'a'.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import re
def text_match(text):
    patterns = 'ab*?'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```
