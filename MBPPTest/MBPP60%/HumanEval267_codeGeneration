CodeGeneration:
ncrement the length counter (current word continues)
4. After iteration, return the final length counter (which will be length of last word)

Here's the complete function:

```python
def length_Of_Last_Word(a): 
    l = 0
    x = a.strip() 
    for i in range(len(x)): 
        if x[i] == " ": 
            l = 0
        else: 
            l += 1
    return l
```
