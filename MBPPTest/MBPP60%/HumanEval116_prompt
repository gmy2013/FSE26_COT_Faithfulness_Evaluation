The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sd_calc` calculates the sample standard deviation.
2. It first checks if the data length is <= 1 and returns 0.0 in that case.
3. It calculates the mean by calling `avg_calc(data)`.
4. It initializes `sd` to 0.0 for accumulating squared differences.
5. For each element in data, it adds the squared difference from the mean to `sd`.
6. It divides the accumulated value by (n-1) for sample variance
