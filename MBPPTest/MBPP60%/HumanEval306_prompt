The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `lucky_num(n)` aims to generate the first `n` lucky numbers.
2. The initial list `List` is created with `range(-1, n*n+9, 2)`, which generates odd numbers starting from 1 (since -1 is included but will be removed later) up to approximately `n*n`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 2, which corresponds to the index of the next number to use for sieving (the second element in the list after the first few are removed).
4. The while loop continues as long as `List[i:]` is non-empty, meaning there are still elements to consider for sieving.
5. In each iteration:
   - The current sieve number is `List[i]`.
   - The elements to remove are those at indices that are multiples of `List[i]` (i.e., `List[List[i]::List[i]]`).
   - The list is upda
