CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function implementation based on the chain of thought:

```python
def get_Pairs_Count(arr, n, sum):
    """
    Count the number of pairs in an array that sum to a specific target value.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): The input array of numbers
        n (int): The length of the array
        sum (int): The target sum value
    
    Returns:
        int: The count of pairs that sum to the target value
    """
    count = 0  # Initialize counter for valid pairs
    
    # Outer loop: iterate through each element
    for i in range(0, n):
        # Inner loop: iterate through all subsequent elements
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Check if current pair sums to target
            if arr[i] + arr[j] == sum:
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

This implementation follows the exact logic described in the chain of thought:
- Initializes a counter at 0
- Uses nested loops where the outer loop goes through each element
- The inner loop checks all elements after the current one to avoid duplicates
- Increments the counter when a valid pair is found
- Returns the total count of valid pairs

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) due to the nested loops, which is appropriate for this straightforward approach.
