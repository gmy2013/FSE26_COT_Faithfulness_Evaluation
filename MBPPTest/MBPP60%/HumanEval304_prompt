The following is chain of thought:
1. The `factorial(start, end)` function calculates the product of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive.
2. The `sum_of_square(n)` function attempts to compute a value using two calls to `factorial`.
3. The expression `factorial(n + 1, 2 * n) / factorial(1, n)` appears to be a ratio of products.
4. This ratio is equivalent to the central binomial coefficient: (2n choose n) = (2n)!/(n! * n!).
5. However, the expression given is (product from n+1 to 2n) / (product from 1 to n) = (2n)!/(n! * n!).
6. The central binomial coeffici
