CodeGeneration:
5. If found, set `res` to `True` and break out of the loop early since we only need to know if at least one element exists.
6. Return the result `res`.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def check_element(test_tup, check_list):
    """
    Check if any element from check_list exists in test_tup.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): The tuple to search in
        check_list (list): The list of elements to check for
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if any element from check_list is found in test_tup, False otherwise
    """
    res = False
    for ele in check_list:
        if ele in test_tup:
            res = True
            break
    return res
```
