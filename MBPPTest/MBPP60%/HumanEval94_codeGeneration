CodeGeneration:
Based on your chain of thought analysis, the function `check_greater` is already correctly implemented. The function:

1. Uses `zip()` to pair corresponding elements from both tuples
2. Uses a generator expression to check if each element from `test_tup1` is less than the corresponding element from `test_tup2`
3. Uses `all()` to ensure all pairs satisfy the condition
4. Returns `True` if all elements in `test_tup1` are less than their counterparts in `test_tup2`, otherwise returns `False`

The implementation is complete and correct for the described functionality. No changes are needed.

```python
def check_greater(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = all(x < y for x, y in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res)
```
