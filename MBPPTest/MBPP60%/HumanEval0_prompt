The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the max_chain_length function:

1. **Initialize variables**: 
   - Set `max = 0` to track the maximum chain length found
   - Create `mcl` (maximum chain length) array initialized to 1 for all positions

2. **Dynamic programming approach**:
   - Use nested loops to compare each pair with all previous pairs
   - Outer loop iterates from index 1 to n-1 (current pair being considered)
   - Inner loop iterates from index 0 to i-1 (all previous pairs)

3. **Chain condition check**:
   - For each pair comparison, check if current pair's `a` > previous pair's `b`
   - Also check if current chain length can be improved by extending previous chain

4. **Update chain length**:
   - If conditions are me
