def floor_Min(A,B,N):
    x = max(B - 1,N)
    return (A*x) // B
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `floor_Min` takes three integer arguments: A, B, and N.
2. The goal is to compute the floor of (A*x)/B for an integer x in the range [0, N].
3. The solution sets x to the maximum of (B-1) and N, which ensures x is at least B-1 but not exceeding N if N is larger.
4. Then it
