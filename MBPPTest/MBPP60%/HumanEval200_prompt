  if len(result)==3:

  else:

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `test_three_equal` takes three arguments: `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. Create a set from the list `[x, y, z]`. Sets automatically remove duplicates, so the set will contain unique values only.
3. Check the length of the set:
   - If the length is 3, that means all three values are distinct (no duplicates), so return 0.
   - Otherwise, there are duplicates. The number of duplicates can be inferred by how much the set length
