CodeGeneration:
ters don't match**: If the last characters are different, we have two choices - include the last character of X or include the last character of Y. We take the minimum of these two options and add 1.

Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def super_seq(X, Y, m, n):
    """
    Compute the length of the shortest common supersequence of two sequences.
    
    Args:
        X: First sequence
        Y: Second sequence
        m: Length of sequence X
        n: Length of sequence Y
    
    Returns:
        int: Length of the shortest common supersequence
    """
    if not m:
        return n
    if not n:
        return m
    if X[m - 1] == Y[n - 1]:
        return 1 + super_seq(X, Y, m - 1, n - 1)
    return 1 + min(super_seq(X, Y, m - 1, n), super_seq(X, Y, m, n - 1))
```
