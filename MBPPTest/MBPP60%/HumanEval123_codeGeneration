CodeGeneration:
convert it to an integer, and sum all these integers
4. Return the resulting sum

Here's the complete function:

```python
def power_base_sum(base, power):
    """Calculate the sum of the digits of base raised to the given power.
    
    Args:
        base (int): The base number
        power (int): The exponent to raise the base to
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of all digits in base^power
    """
    return sum([int(i) for i in str(pow(base, power))])
```
