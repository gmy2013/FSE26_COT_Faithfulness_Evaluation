CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought analysis, the current implementation has a logical error - it only checks the first word and returns immediately without checking all words. The function should return `True` if ANY word has even length, and `False` only if ALL words have odd length.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def word_len(s):
    """
    Return True if any word in the string has even length, False otherwise.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Input string containing words separated by spaces
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if any word has even length, False if all words have odd length
    """
    s = s.split(' ')
    for word in s:
        if len(word) % 2 == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the `else` clause that returned `False` immediately
2. Added a final `return False` statement that only executes after checking ALL words
3. This ensures the function checks every word and only returns `False` if no word has even length
