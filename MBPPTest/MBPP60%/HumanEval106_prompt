The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the count_Set_Bits function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function counts the total number of set bits (1s) in the binary representations of all numbers from 0 to n

2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Increment n by 1 to include 0 in the count (0 to n inclusive)
   - Initialize powerOf2 to 2 (starting with the least significant bit)
   - Initialize cnt to n//2 (each number contributes at least 1 set bit for the LSB)

3. **Bit Position Processing**: For each bit position (powerOf2):
   - Calculate totalPairs: number of complete pairs of numbers that have this bit position
   - Add (totalPairs//2)*powerOf2: each pair contributes powerOf2 set bits
   - Handle the remaining numbers if totalPairs is o
