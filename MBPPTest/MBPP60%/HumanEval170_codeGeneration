CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function with the issue fixed:

```python
from collections import deque

def check_expression(exp):
    if len(exp) & 1:
        return False
    stack = deque()
    for ch in exp:
        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':
            stack.append(ch)
        elif ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':
            if not stack:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if (top == '(' and ch != ')') or (top == '{' and ch != '}') or (top == '[' and ch != ']'):
                return False
    return not stack
```

The issue was in the condition checking for bracket matching. There was a missing closing parenthesis in the condition:
```python
(top == '{' and ch != '}' or (top == '[' and ch != ']'))
```
should be:
```python
(top == '{' and ch != '}') or (top == '[' and ch != ']')
```

I also changed the second `if` to `elif` for better code clarity, though both would work functionally.
