CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the chain of thought:

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
  if (len(numbers)<2):
    return
  if ((len(numbers)==2)  and (numbers[0] == numbers[1]) ):
    return
  dup_items = set()
  uniq_items = []
  for x in numbers:
    if x not in dup_items:
      uniq_items.append(x)
      dup_items.add(x)
  uniq_items.sort()    
  return  uniq_items[1]
```

**Chain of thought:**
1. Check if the input list has fewer than 2 elements - return None if true
2. Check if the list has exactly 2 elements that are equal - return None if true
3. Create a set to track duplicates and a list for unique items
4. Iterate through input numbers, adding each unique number to both the set and list
5. Sort the unique items in ascending order
6. Return the second element (index 1) which is the second smallest unique value

The function handles edge cases where there aren't enough distinct values to determine a second smallest number, and returns the second smallest unique value from the input list.
