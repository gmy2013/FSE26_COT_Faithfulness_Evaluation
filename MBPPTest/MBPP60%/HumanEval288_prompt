def reverse_list_lists(lists):
    for l in lists:
        l.sort(reverse = True)
    return lists 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `reverse_list_lists` takes a list of lists as input.
2. It iterates over each sublist in the input list.
3. For each sublist, it sorts the elements in descending order using `sort(reverse=True)`.
4. The function returns the modified list of lists with each sublist sorted
