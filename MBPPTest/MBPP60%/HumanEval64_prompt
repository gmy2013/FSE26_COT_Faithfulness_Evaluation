def move_last(num_list):
    a = [num_list[0] for i in range(num_list.count(num_list[0]))]
    x = [ i for i in num_list if i != num_list[0]]
    x.extend(a)
    return (x)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `move_last` takes a list `num_list` as input.
2. The goal is to move all occurrences of the first element to the end of the list.
3. First, create a list `a` containing the first element repeated as many times as it appears in `num_list`.
   - `num_list[0]` gets the first element.
   - `num_list.count(num_list[0])` counts how many times the first element appears.
   - The list comprehension creates a list with that many copies of the first element.
4. Then, create a list `x` containing all
