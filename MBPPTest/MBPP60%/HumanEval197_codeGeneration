CodeGeneration:
rent element `i` to the `sum`.
5. After processing all elements, return the accumulated `sum`.

The provided code already correctly implements this logic. Here is the complete function:

```python
def _sum(arr):  
    sum=0
    for i in arr: 
        sum = sum + i      
    return(sum)
```

This function will work for any iterable containing numbers (integers, floats, etc.) and returns their sum.
