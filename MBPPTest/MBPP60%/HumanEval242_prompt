The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the problem**: The function finds the nth super ugly number, which is a positive integer whose prime factors are all in the given list of primes.
2. **Initial setup**: Start with the first ugly number, 1, stored in the list `uglies`.
3. **Generator function**: Define a helper generator `gen` that multiplies each existing ugly number by a given prime, yielding potential next ugly numbers.
4. **Merge generators**: Use `heapq.merge` to combine generators for each prime, creating a sorted stream of candidate numbers.
5. **Build the list**: Iterate through the me
