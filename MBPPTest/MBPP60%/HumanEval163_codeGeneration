CodeGeneration:
s a digit by comparing it to the characters '0' and '9'.
5. If the character is a digit, increment the counter `number_ctr` by 1.
6. After processing all characters, return the total count of digits.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def number_ctr(str):
    number_ctr = 0
    for i in range(len(str)):
        if str[i] >= '0' and str[i] <= '9':
            number_ctr += 1
    return number_ctr
```

Alternatively, here's a more Pythonic version using string methods:

```python
def number_ctr(s):
    return sum(1 for char in s if char.isdigit())
```

Both versions achieve the same result - counting the number of digits in the input string.
