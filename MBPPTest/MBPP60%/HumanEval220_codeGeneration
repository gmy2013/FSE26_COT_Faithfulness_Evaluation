CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the chain of thought:

```python
import collections as ct

def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    """
    Merge two dictionaries with dict2 values taking precedence over dict1.
    
    Args:
        dict1 (dict): First dictionary to merge
        dict2 (dict): Second dictionary to merge (higher priority)
    
    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary containing merged key-value pairs
    
    Example:
        >>> merge_dictionaries({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'b': 3, 'c': 4})
        {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
    """
    merged_dict = dict(ct.ChainMap({}, dict1, dict2))
    return merged_dict
```

The chain of thought is correct:
1. `ChainMap` processes dictionaries from right to left, so `dict2` (rightmost) has highest priority
2. The empty dictionary `{}` is placed first to ensure the result is a regular dictionary rather than a ChainMap object
3. When converted to a regular dict, the final result preserves the priority order where `dict2` values override `dict1` values for conflicting keys
4. The function returns a new dictionary containing all keys from both inputs with appropriate value resolution
