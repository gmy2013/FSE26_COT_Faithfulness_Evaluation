CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the corrected implementation:

```python
def substract_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """
    Subtract corresponding elements from two nested tuples element-wise.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1 (tuple): First nested tuple containing tuples of numbers
        test_tup2 (tuple): Second nested tuple containing tuples of numbers
    
    Returns:
        tuple: Resulting nested tuple with element-wise subtraction
    
    Example:
        >>> substract_elements(((1, 2), (3, 4)), ((0, 1), (1, 2)))
        ((1, 1), (2, 2))
    """
    res = tuple(tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2)) 
               for tup1, tup2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
    return res
```

The function:
1. Uses nested tuple comprehensions to process the nested structure
2. Outer `zip()` pairs corresponding inner tuples from both input tuples
3. Inner `zip()` pairs corresponding elements within each inner tuple pair
4. Performs element-wise subtraction (a - b) for each element pair
5. Returns the result as a nested tuple with the same structure as the inputs
