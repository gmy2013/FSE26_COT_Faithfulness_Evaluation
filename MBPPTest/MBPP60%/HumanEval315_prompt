The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze the function step by step:

1. The function has nested loops that iterate through all possible triplets (i, j, k)
2. When it finds a triplet that sums to the target, it returns the triplet values AND then returns True
3. This creates a problem because the second return statement will never be reached
4. The function should either return the triplet or return True/False, but not both
5. The current implementation has a logical error in the return flow

The function should be corrected to either:
- Return the triplet when found (and handle the False case appropriately)
- Return True when found and False when not found

Based on the function name "find_
