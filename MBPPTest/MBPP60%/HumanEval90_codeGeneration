CodeGeneration:
- The key is the second element of the tuples.
   - The value is a list of first elements from all tuples in that group.
5. The grouped dictionary is returned.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from itertools import groupby 

def group_element(test_list):
    """
    Groups elements of a list of tuples by their second element.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): A list of tuples where each tuple contains at least two elements.
        
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are the second elements from the tuples,
              and values are lists of first elements grouped by the key.
              
    Example:
        >>> group_element([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 1), ('d', 3), ('e', 2)])
        {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b', 'e'], 3: ['d']}
    """
    res = dict()
    for key, val in groupby(sorted(test_list, key=lambda ele: ele[1]), key=lambda ele: ele[1]):
        res[key] = [ele[0] for ele in val] 
    return res
```
