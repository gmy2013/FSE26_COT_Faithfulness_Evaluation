def filter_data(students,h,w):
    result = {k: s for k, s in students.items() if s[0] >=h and s[1] >=w}
    return result    
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Filter a dictionary of students based on height and weight thresholds.
2. Analyze parameters:
   - `students`: Dictionary with student IDs as keys and tuples (height, weight) as values
   - `h`: Minimum height threshold
   - `w`: Minimum weight threshold
3. Process the dictionary comprehension:
   - Iterate through each key-value pair in students dictionary
   - Check
