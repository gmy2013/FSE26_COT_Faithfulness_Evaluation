The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of lists (`list1`) as input.
2. Initialize an empty dictionary `result` to store the counts.
3. Iterate over each sublist `l` in `list1`:
   - Convert the sublist `l` to a tuple (since lists are unhashable and cannot be dictionary keys).
   - Use `setdefault` to initialize the key (the tuple) with an empty list if it doesn't exist.
   - Append `1` to the list associated with that key (to later coun
