def count_even(array_nums):
   count_even = len(list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) , array_nums)))
   return count_even
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_even` takes one parameter: `array_nums`, which is expected to be a list of numbers.
2. Inside the function, a `filter` is applied to `array_nums` using a lambda function that checks if each element is even (i.e., `x % 2 == 0`).
3. The filtered result (an iterator of even numbers) is converted to a list.
4. The length of this list (number of even el
