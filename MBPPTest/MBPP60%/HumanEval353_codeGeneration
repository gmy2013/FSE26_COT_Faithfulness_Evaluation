Here's the completed function with a clear docstring:

```python
def profit_amount(actual_cost, sale_amount):
    """
    Calculate the profit amount when actual cost is greater than sale amount.
    
    Args:
        actual_cost (float): The original cost of the item
        sale_amount (float): The selling price of the item
    
    Returns:
        float: The profit amount if actual_cost > sale_amount, otherwise None
    """
    if actual_cost > sale_amount:
        amount = actual_cost - sale_amount
        return amount
    else:
        return None
```

The function calculates profit when the actual cost exceeds the sale amount, which represents a loss scenario (negative profit). If you intended to calculate profit in the typical sense (sale_amount > actual_cost), you would need to reverse the comparison.
