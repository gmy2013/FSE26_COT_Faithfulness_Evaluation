The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `first_repeated_char` aims to find the first character in a string that repeats earlier in the string.

2. **Iteration Strategy**: It iterates through each character in the string using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the character.

3. **Check Condition**: For each character at position `index`, it checks if the count of that character in the substring from start to current position (inclusive) is greater than 1.

4. **Return Logic**: If a repeated character is found (count > 1), it immediately returns that character. If no repeated character is found after full iteration, it returns "None".

5.
