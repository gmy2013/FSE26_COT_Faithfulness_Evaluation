def even_position(nums):
	return all(nums[i]%2==i%2 for i in range(len(nums)))
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Check if every element at index i has the same parity (even/odd) as its index i.
2. Analyze the return statement: Uses a generator expression with `all()` to verify the condition for all indices.
3. Break
