Here's the completed function with the chain of thought implemented:

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
  """
  Returns the second smallest distinct number in the list.
  
  Args:
    numbers: List of numbers (integers or floats)
  
  Returns:
    The second smallest distinct number, or None if:
    - List has fewer than 2 elements
    - List has exactly 2 elements that are equal
    - There are fewer than 2 distinct numbers
  """
  if len(numbers) < 2:
    return None
  
  if len(numbers) == 2 and numbers[0] == numbers[1]:
    return None
  
  # Remove duplicates
  dup_items = set()
  uniq_items = []
  for x in numbers:
    if x not in dup_items:
      uniq_items.append(x)
      dup_items.add(x)
  
  # Check if we have at least 2 distinct numbers
  if len(uniq_items) < 2:
    return None
  
  uniq_items.sort()    
  return uniq_items[1]
```

The function follows the chain of thought:
1. First checks if the list has fewer than 2 elements and returns None
2. Then checks if there are exactly 2 elements that are equal and returns None
3. Removes duplicates using a set to track seen items
4. Sorts the unique items and returns the second smallest (index 1)
5. Added an additional check to ensure there are at least 2 distinct numbers after removing duplicates
