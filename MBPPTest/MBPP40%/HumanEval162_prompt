def find_Min_Diff(arr,n): 
    arr = sorted(arr) 
    diff = 10**20 
    for i in range(n-1): 
        if arr[i+1] - arr[i] < diff: 
            diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]  
    return diff 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `find_Min_Diff` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as inputs.
2. The goal is to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
3. First, sort the array to arrange elements in ascending order. This allows adjacent elements to be the closest in value.
4. Initialize `diff`
