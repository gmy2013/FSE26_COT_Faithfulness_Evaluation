CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function:

```python
def concatenate_nested(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """Concatenate two tuples.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1 (tuple): The first tuple to concatenate
        test_tup2 (tuple): The second tuple to concatenate
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A new tuple containing all elements from both input tuples
        
    Examples:
        >>> concatenate_nested((1, 2), (3, 4))
        (1, 2, 3, 4)
        >>> concatenate_nested(('a', 'b'), ('c',))
        ('a', 'b', 'c')
    """
    res = test_tup1 + test_tup2
    return (res)
```

The function correctly concatenates two tuples using the `+` operator, which creates a new tuple containing all elements from both input tuples in order. The parentheses around the return value are redundant but don't affect the functionality.
