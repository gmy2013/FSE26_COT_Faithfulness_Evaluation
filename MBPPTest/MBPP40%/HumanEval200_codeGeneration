CodeGeneration:
return 0
   - Otherwise, return (4 - length) which will be:
        * 2 if there are two duplicates (length=2)
        * 3 if all three are the same (length=1)

Here's the complete function:

```python
def test_three_equal(x, y, z):
    """Return 0 if all three values are different, 2 if exactly two are equal, or 3 if all three are equal.
    
    Args:
        x: First value
        y: Second value  
        z: Third value
        
    Returns:
        int: 0, 2, or 3 depending on the equality pattern
    """
    result = set([x, y, z])
    if len(result) == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return (4 - len(result))
```
