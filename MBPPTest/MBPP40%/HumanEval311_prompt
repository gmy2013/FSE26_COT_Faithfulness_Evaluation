The following is chain of thought:
We are given two functions: binomial_coeff and lobb_num.
The binomial_coeff function uses dynamic programming to compute binomial coefficients.
The lobb_num function computes the Lobb number using the formula: ((2*m+1) * binom(2*n, m+n)) / (m+n+1)

However, note that the binomial_coeff function uses integer arithmetic, but the division in lobb_num might require floating point.
But since Lobb numbers are integers, we should use integer division? Actually, the formula always yields an integer.

But the code uses integer operations. However, the division in lobb_num uses `/` which in Python 2 is integer division if both operands are integers, but in Python 3 it is float division.
To ensure integer result (since Lobb numbers are integers) and to be compatible with both Python versions, we should us
