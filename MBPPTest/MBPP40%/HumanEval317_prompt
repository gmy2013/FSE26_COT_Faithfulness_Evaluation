The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the coin_change function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: This function solves the classic coin change problem - counting the number of ways to make change for amount 'n' using coins from set 'S' of size 'm'

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: 
   - Create a 2D DP table with dimensions (n+1) Ã— m
   - table[i][j] represents number of ways to make amount 'i' using first 'j+1' coins

3. **Base Case Initialization**:
   - For amount 0 (i=0), there's exactly 1 way to m
