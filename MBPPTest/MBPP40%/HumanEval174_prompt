def odd_position(nums):
	return all(nums[i]%2==i%2 for i in range(len(nums)))

1. Understand the function purpose: Check if all elements at odd positions (index-based) are odd numbers and elements at even positions are even numbers.
2. Analyze the return statement: Uses a generator expression with `all()` to verify the condition for every index.
3. B
