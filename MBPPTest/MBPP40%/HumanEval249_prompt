The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `is_triangleexists` appears to check if three angles can form a valid triangle
2. **First Condition Check**: The function verifies if all angles are non-zero and their sum equals 180Â° (triangle angle sum property)
3. **Second Condition Check**: The function then checks triangle i
