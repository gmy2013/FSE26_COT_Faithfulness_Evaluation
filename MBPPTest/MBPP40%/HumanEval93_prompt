def extract_unique(test_dict):
  res = list(sorted({ele for val in test_dict.values() for ele in val}))
  return res
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `extract_unique` takes a dictionary `test_dict` as input.
2. The goal is to extract all unique elements from all the values in the dictionary.
3. The values in the dictionary are assumed to be iterable (e.g., lists, sets, tuples).
