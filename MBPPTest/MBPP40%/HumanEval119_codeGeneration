CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the corrected docstring:

```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(test_tup, test_dict):
    """
    Add a dictionary to the end of a tuple and return the new tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): The original tuple to which the dictionary will be added
        test_dict (dict): The dictionary to be added to the tuple
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A new tuple containing all elements from the original tuple plus the dictionary at the end
    """
    test_tup = list(test_tup)
    test_tup.append(test_dict)
    test_tup = tuple(test_tup)
    return test_tup
```

The function works by:
1. Converting the input tuple to a list to make it mutable
2. Appending the input dictionary to the list
3. Converting the modified list back to a tuple
4. Returning the new tuple containing the original elements plus the dictionary at the end
