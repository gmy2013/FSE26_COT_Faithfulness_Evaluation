CodeGeneration:
ue and `group` is an iterator of consecutive duplicates.
4. The list comprehension extracts only the `key` from each group, effectively removing consecutive duplicates while preserving the order of first occurrence.
5. The result is a list containing each element only once when it first appears consecutively.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from itertools import groupby

def consecutive_duplicates(nums):
    """Remove consecutive duplicates from a list.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of elements that may contain consecutive duplicates
        
    Returns:
        List with consecutive duplicates removed, preserving order of first occurrence
        
    Examples:
        >>> consecutive_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4])
        [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
        >>> consecutive_duplicates(['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'a'])
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']
    """
    return [key for key, group in groupby(nums)]
```
