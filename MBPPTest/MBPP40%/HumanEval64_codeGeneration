CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function with the completed docstring:

```python
def move_last(num_list):
    """
    Move all occurrences of the first element to the end of the list.
    
    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of numbers
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list where all occurrences of the first element are moved to the end,
              while maintaining the relative order of all other elements.
    
    Example:
        >>> move_last([1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1])
        [2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1]
        >>> move_last([5, 5, 5])
        [5, 5, 5]
        >>> move_last([1, 2, 3])
        [2, 3, 1]
    """
    a = [num_list[0] for i in range(num_list.count(num_list[0]))]
    x = [ i for i in num_list if i != num_list[0]]
    x.extend(a)
    return (x)
```

The function works by:
1. Creating list `a` with all occurrences of the first element
2. Creating list `x` with all elements except the first element
3. Appending all occurrences of the first element to the end of `x`
4. Returning the modified list

This effectively moves all instances of the first element to the end while preserving the original order of all other elements.
