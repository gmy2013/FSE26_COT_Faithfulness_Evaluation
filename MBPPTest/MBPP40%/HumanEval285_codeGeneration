CodeGeneration:
The average (mean) of the input numbers.

Here's the corrected function with proper docstring:

```python
def sum_num(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average (mean) of a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers (int or float)
    
    Returns:
        float: The average of the input numbers
    
    Example:
        >>> sum_num([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        3.0
        >>> sum_num([10, 20, 30])
        20.0
    """
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    return total / len(numbers)
```

Note: The function name `sum_num` is somewhat misleading since it actually calculates the average rather than just summing numbers. A more descriptive name would be `calculate_average` or `mean`, but I've kept the original function name as requested.
