CodeGeneration:
is correct for checking if all elements of `test_tuple` are present in `K`.

Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def check_tuples(test_tuple, K):
    """Check if all elements in test_tuple are present in K.
    
    Args:
        test_tuple: A tuple whose elements need to be checked
        K: A container (list, tuple, set, etc.) to check membership against
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements of test_tuple are in K, False otherwise
    """
    res = all(ele in K for ele in test_tuple)
    return res
```

The implementation correctly uses:
- `all()` to check if all elements satisfy a condition
- A generator expression `(ele in K for ele in test_tuple)` to check membership
- The `in` operator to test if each element exists in `K`

This works efficiently for any iterable `K` (list, tuple, set, etc.) and handles empty tuples correctly (returns True for empty input).
