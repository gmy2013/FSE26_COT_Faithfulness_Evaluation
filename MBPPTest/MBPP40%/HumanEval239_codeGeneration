CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided code and the chain of thought, here's the completed function with an appropriate docstring:

```python
def Check_Solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if the equation a*x + b = c has a solution.
    
    For the linear equation a*x + b = c to have a solution:
    - If a != 0, there is always a unique solution
    - If a == 0, the equation becomes b = c, so:
        * If b == c, there are infinitely many solutions
        * If b != c, there is no solution
    
    This function specifically checks if b == 0, which might indicate
    a special case where the equation simplifies to a*x = c.
    
    Args:
        a (float): Coefficient of x
        b (float): Constant term
        c (float): Right-hand side constant
    
    Returns:
        str: "Yes" if b == 0, "No" otherwise
    """
    if b == 0:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"
```
