The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `all_Characters_Same` checks if all characters in a string `s` are identical.
2. It first calculates the length of the string and stores it in `n`.
3. It then iterates from index 1 to the end of the string (index `n-1`).
4. For each character at index `i`, it compares it with th
