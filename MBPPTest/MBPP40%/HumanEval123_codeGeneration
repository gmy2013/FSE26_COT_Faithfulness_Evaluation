Here's the completed function with the chain of thought:

```python
def power_base_sum(base, power):
    """
    Calculate base raised to the given power, then return the sum of its digits.
    
    Args:
        base (int): The base number
        power (int): The exponent to raise the base to
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of the digits of base^power
    
    Examples:
        >>> power_base_sum(2, 3)
        8
        >>> power_base_sum(2, 4)
        7
        >>> power_base_sum(10, 2)
        1
    """
    return sum([int(i) for i in str(pow(base, power))])
```

Chain of thought:
1. Calculate base raised to the given power using `pow(base, power)`
2. Convert the resulting number to a string to access each digit individually
3. Convert each character in the string back to an integer
4. Sum all the integer digits using the `sum()` function
5. Return the final sum

The function correctly implements this logic to calculate the sum of digits for any base raised to any power.
