CodeGeneration:
Looking at this implementation, I can see it's checking for isomorphism by comparing the patterns of character positions. However, there's a more efficient way to implement this using a single pass through both strings.

Here's an improved implementation:

```python
def is_Isomorphic(str1, str2):
    """
    Check if two strings are isomorphic.
    
    Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in str1 can be replaced to get str2,
    with the mapping being consistent throughout the string.
    
    Args:
        str1 (str): First input string
        str2 (str): Second input string
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if strings are isomorphic, False otherwise
    
    Examples:
        >>> is_Isomorphic("egg", "add")
        True
        >>> is_Isomorphic("foo", "bar")
        False
        >>> is_Isomorphic("paper", "title")
        True
    """
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        return False
    
    mapping = {}
    mapped_chars = set()
    
    for char1, char2 in zip(str1, str2):
        if char1 in mapping:
            if mapping[char1] != char2:
                return False
        else:
            if char2 in mapped_chars:
                return False
            mapping[char1] = char2
            mapped_chars.add(char2)
    
    return True
```

The key improvements:
1. **Single pass**: Processes both strings simultaneously using `zip()`
2. **Early termination**: Returns `False` immediately when inconsistency is found
3. **Two-way validation**: Ensures the mapping is one-to-one (no two characters map to the same character)
4. **Length check**: Handles strings of different lengths upfront
5. **Memory efficient**: Uses O(n) space instead of building full index lists

This approach is more efficient both in time (O(n)) and space (O(n)) compared to the original implementation which builds complete index mappings before comparison.
