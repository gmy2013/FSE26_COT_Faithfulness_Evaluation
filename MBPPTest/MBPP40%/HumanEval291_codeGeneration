6. The function returns the modified string.

Here is the complete function:

```python
import re

def remove_spaces(text):
    """Remove extra spaces from text by replacing multiple spaces with a single space.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Input string that may contain multiple consecutive spaces
        
    Returns:
        str: String with multiple consecutive spaces replaced by single spaces
        
    Examples:
        >>> remove_spaces("Hello    world")
        'Hello world'
        >>> remove_spaces("Python  is   great")
        'Python is great'
        >>> remove_spaces("NoExtraSpaces")
        'NoExtraSpaces'
    """
    return re.sub(' +', ' ', text)
```
