from collections import Counter 
	
def second_frequent(input): 
	dict = Counter(input) 
	value = sorted(dict.values(), reverse=True)  
	second_large = value[1] 
	for (key, val) in dict.items(): 
		if val == second_large: 
			return (key) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function uses Counter to count frequency of elements in input
2. It sorts the frequency values in descending order
3. It takes the second value from the sorted list (index 1) as the second largest frequency
4. It iterates through the counter items to find the key that matches this second
