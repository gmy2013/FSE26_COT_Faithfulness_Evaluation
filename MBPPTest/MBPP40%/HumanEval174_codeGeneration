Here's the complete function with docstring:

```python
def odd_position(nums):
    """
    Check if all elements at odd indices are odd numbers and elements at even indices are even numbers.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if for every index i, nums[i] has the same parity as i (even indices have even numbers, 
              odd indices have odd numbers), False otherwise
              
    Examples:
        >>> odd_position([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5])
        True
        >>> odd_position([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 4])
        False
        >>> odd_position([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        True
    """
    return all(nums[i] % 2 == i % 2 for i in range(len(nums)))
```

The function works by checking if each element has the same parity (even/odd) as its index position. The expression `nums[i] % 2 == i % 2` evaluates to `True` when both the number and its index are either even or odd, and `False` otherwise. The `all()` function returns `True` only if this condition holds for every element in the list.
