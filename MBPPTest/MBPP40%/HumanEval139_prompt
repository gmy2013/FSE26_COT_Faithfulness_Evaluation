def tuple_to_dict(test_tup):
  res = dict(test_tup[idx : idx + 2] for idx in range(0, len(test_tup), 2))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
2. The goal is to convert the tuple into a dictionary by grouping elements into key-value pairs.
3. The approach uses a generator expression inside the `dict()` constructor.
4. The generator iterates over indices starting from 0, stepping by 2 each time.
5. For each index `idx`, it sli
