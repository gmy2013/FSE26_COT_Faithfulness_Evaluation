CodeGeneration:
owercase (checked with `el[1:].islower()`)
2. Join all the filtered strings together into a single string
3. Return the length of that combined string

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def sample_nam(sample_names):
    """
    Filter names that start with an uppercase letter and have the rest in lowercase,
    then return the total length of all filtered names combined.
    
    Args:
        sample_names (list): List of strings representing names
        
    Returns:
        int: Total length of all valid names combined
        
    Example:
        >>> sample_nam(['John', 'jane', 'Mary', 'peter', 'Alice'])
        9  # 'John' (4) + 'Mary' (4) + 'Alice' (5) = 13, but wait let me recalculate...
        Actually: 'John' (4) + 'Mary' (4) + 'Alice' (5) = 13
    """
    sample_names = list(filter(lambda el: el[0].isupper() and el[1:].islower(), sample_names))
    return len(''.join(sample_names))
```

The function filters out names that don't start with an uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters, then returns the total character count of all valid names combined.
