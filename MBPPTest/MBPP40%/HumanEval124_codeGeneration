CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
import re

def extract_quotation(text1):
    """Extract all text within double quotes from the input string.
    
    Args:
        text1 (str): The input string containing quoted text
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of strings found within double quotes
        
    Examples:
        >>> extract_quotation('Hello "world" and "universe"')
        ['world', 'universe']
        >>> extract_quotation('No quotes here')
        []
    """
    return (re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', text1))
```

The function uses a regular expression pattern `r'"(.*?)"'` which:
- `"` matches the opening double quote
- `(.*?)` captures any characters (non-greedy match) between the quotes
- `"` matches the closing double quote

The `re.findall()` method returns all non-overlapping matches as a list of strings.
