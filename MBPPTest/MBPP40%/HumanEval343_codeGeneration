CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function with a complete implementation:

```python
import re
def num_position(text):
    """Return the starting index of the first number in the text.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to search for numbers
        
    Returns:
        int: The starting index of the first number, or None if no number is found
    """
    for m in re.finditer(r"\d+", text):
        return m.start()
    return None
```

The function now:
1. Uses a raw string `r"\d+"` for the regex pattern (best practice)
2. Returns `None` if no numbers are found in the text
3. Includes proper docstring documentation
4. Still efficiently returns the starting position of the first number found

The function will return immediately when it finds the first number match, making it efficient for finding just the first occurrence.
