The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_duplic` takes a list `lists` as input.
2. It initializes two empty lists: `element` to store unique elements and `frequency` to store their consecutive frequencies.
3. It checks if the input list is empty. If so, it returns an empty `element` list.
4. It initializes `running_count` to 1 to start counting consecutive duplicates.
5. It
