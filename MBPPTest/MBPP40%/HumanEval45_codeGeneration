Here's the completed function with improved clarity and documentation:

```python
def No_of_cubes(N, K):
    """
    Calculate the number of cubes of side length K that can fit inside a larger cube of side length N.
    
    The number of cubes along one dimension is (N - K + 1) because we can position
    the smaller cube at integer coordinates from 0 to (N - K) along each axis.
    
    Args:
        N (int): Side length of the larger cube
        K (int): Side length of the smaller cubes
    
    Returns:
        int: Total number of K-sized cubes that fit in the N-sized cube
    """
    No = 0
    No = (N - K + 1)
    No = pow(No, 3)
    return No
```

The function correctly calculates the number of smaller cubes by:
1. Finding how many positions the smaller cube can occupy along one dimension: (N - K + 1)
2. Cubing this value since we're working in 3D space
3. Returning the total count

For example: No_of_cubes(5, 2) = (5 - 2 + 1)^3 = 4^3 = 64 cubes
