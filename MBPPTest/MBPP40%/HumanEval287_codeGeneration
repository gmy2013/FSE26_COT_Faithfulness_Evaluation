CodeGeneration:
Based on your chain of thought, here's the completed function with proper formatting:

```python
def substract_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """
    Subtract corresponding elements from two nested tuples element-wise.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1 (tuple): A tuple containing tuples of numbers
        test_tup2 (tuple): A tuple containing tuples of numbers with same dimensions as test_tup1
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing tuples with element-wise subtraction results
    
    Example:
        >>> substract_elements(((1, 2), (3, 4)), ((0, 1), (1, 2)))
        ((1, 1), (2, 2))
    """
    res = tuple(tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
               for tup1, tup2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
    return res
```

The function:
1. Uses nested `zip()` to iterate through corresponding inner tuples
2. Performs element-wise subtraction within each inner tuple pair
3. Returns a new nested tuple with the subtraction results
4. Maintains the original nested structure of the input tuples
