def left_rotate(s,d):
    tmp = s[d : ] + s[0 : d]
    return tmp  
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for implementing the left_rotate function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function should rotate a string left by d positions
2. **Input Parameters**: 
   - s: input string to be rotated
   - d: number of positions to rotate left
3. **Rotation Strategy**: 
   - Extract substring from position d to end of string
   - Extract substring from beginning to position d
