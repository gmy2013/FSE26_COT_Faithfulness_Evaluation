CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and the chain of thought, this appears to be a complete and correct implementation of a pairwise function. However, I notice this is a standard Python programming pattern, so let me provide the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def pair_wise(l1):
    """
    Generate consecutive element pairs from a list.
    
    Args:
        l1: Input list
        
    Returns:
        List of tuples where each tuple contains consecutive elements from the input list
        
    Example:
        >>> pair_wise([1, 2, 3, 4])
        [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
    """
    temp = []
    for i in range(len(l1) - 1):
        current_element, next_element = l1[i], l1[i + 1]
        x = (current_element, next_element)
        temp.append(x)
    return temp
```

The function correctly:
1. Takes a list as input
2. Creates an empty list to store results
3. Iterates through indices 0 to len(l1)-2
4. Creates tuples of consecutive elements (current, next)
5. Returns the list of tuples

This implementation handles edge cases like empty lists or single-element lists appropriately (returning an empty list in those cases).
