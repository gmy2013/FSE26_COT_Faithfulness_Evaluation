CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from collections import Counter

def max_char(str1):
    """
    Returns the character that appears most frequently in the given string.
    
    Args:
        str1 (str): The input string to analyze
        
    Returns:
        str: The character that appears most frequently in the string.
             If multiple characters have the same maximum frequency,
             returns the one that appears first in the string.
    
    Examples:
        >>> max_char("hello")
        'l'
        >>> max_char("banana")
        'a'
        >>> max_char("test")
        't'
    """
    temp = Counter(str1) 
    max_char = max(temp, key = temp.get)
    return max_char
```

The function uses `Counter` to count character frequencies and then finds the character with the maximum frequency using the `max()` function with `temp.get` as the key. If multiple characters have the same maximum frequency, it returns the one that appears first in the original string due to how `max()` handles ties.
