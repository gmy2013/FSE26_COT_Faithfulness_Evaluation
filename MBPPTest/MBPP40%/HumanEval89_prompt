def mul_consecutive_nums(nums):
    result = [b*a for a, b in zip(nums[:-1], nums[1:])]
    return result
The following is chain of thought:

2. **Identify input**: A list `nums` containing numbers.
3. **Plan the approach**:
   - Use `zip` to pair each element with its next element.
   - Slice the list:
