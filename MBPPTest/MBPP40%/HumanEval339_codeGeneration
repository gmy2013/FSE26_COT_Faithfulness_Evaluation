CodeGeneration:
function does not correctly maintain the max heap property in all cases. The current implementation stops prematurely when a swap occurs by setting `root = child` but doesn't continue checking the new position. It should continue the while loop until no more swaps are needed.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def heap_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in ascending order using the heap sort algorithm.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of comparable elements to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        List: The sorted array in ascending order
    """
    heapify(arr)  
    end = len(arr) - 1
    while end > 0:
        arr[end], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[end]
        shift_down(arr, 0, end - 1)
        end -= 1
    return arr

def heapify(arr):
    """
    Builds a max heap from the given array.
    
    Args:
        arr: List to be transformed into a max heap
    """
    start = len(arr) // 2
    while start >= 0:
        shift_down(arr, start, len(arr) - 1)
        start -= 1

def shift_down(arr, start, end):
    """
    Maintains the max heap property by shifting an element down the heap.
    
    Args:
        arr: The heap array
        start: Index of the element to shift down
        end: Last index of the heap
    """
    root = start
    while root * 2 + 1 <= end:
        child = root * 2 + 1
        # Find the larger child
        if child + 1 <= end and arr[child] < arr[child + 1]:
            child += 1
        # If the root is smaller than the largest child, swap and continue
        if arr[root] < arr[child]:
            arr[root], arr[child] = arr[child], arr[root]
            root = child
        else:
            break
```

The key fix is changing `return` to `break` in the shift_down function, allowing the while loop to continue checking the new position after a swap until the max heap property is fully restored.
