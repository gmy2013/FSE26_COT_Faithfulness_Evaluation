CodeGeneration:
tuple by converting each element to a string and summing their lengths.
4. After sorting, the function returns the string representation of the sorted list.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def sort_list(test_list):
    """
    Sorts the given list of tuples based on the total number of digits in each tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): A list of tuples to be sorted.
        
    Returns:
        str: String representation of the sorted list.
        
    Example:
        >>> sort_list([(1, 2, 3), (10, 20), (100,)])
        '[(1, 2, 3), (10, 20), (100,)]'
    """
    test_list.sort(key=count_digs)
    return str(test_list)
```

The function sorts the list of tuples in ascending order based on the total number of digits across all elements in each tuple, then returns the string representation of the sorted list.
