key in each dictionary.
3. We can use `heapq.nsmallest` to efficiently get the `n` items with the smallest prices.
4. The `key` parameter should extract the 'price' value from each dictionary.
5. Return the list of `n` cheapest items.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import heapq

def cheap_items(items, n):
    """
    Return the n cheapest items from the list based on their price.
    
    Args:
        items (list): A list of dictionaries where each dictionary has a 'price' key.
        n (int): The number of cheapest items to return.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of the n cheapest items.
    """
    cheap_items = heapq.nsmallest(n, items, key=lambda s: s['price'])
    return cheap_items
```
