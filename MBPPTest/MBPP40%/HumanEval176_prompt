The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `find_Sum` appears to calculate the sum of unique elements in an array by eliminating duplicates.

2. **Input Parameters**: 
   - `arr`: An array/list of numbers
   - `n`: The length of the array

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Sort the array in ascending order using `arr.sort()`
   - Initialize `sum` variable with the first element of the sorted array
   - Iterate through the array from index 0 to n-2
   - Compare each element with the
