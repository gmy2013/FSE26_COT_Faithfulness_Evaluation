CodeGeneration:
es that the function should modify the list in place, but the current implementation has issues. Let me provide a corrected version that works correctly.

Here's the improved function:

```python
def remove_even(l):
    """
    Remove all even integers from the list l in place.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of integers to modify
        
    Returns:
        list: The modified list with even numbers removed
    """
    # Iterate backwards to avoid index shifting issues
    for i in range(len(l) - 1, -1, -1):
        if l[i] % 2 == 0:
            del l[i]
    return l
```

Alternative implementation using list comprehension (creates new list instead of modifying in place):

```python
def remove_even(l):
    """
    Remove all even integers from the list l.
    
    Args:
        l (list): List of integers
        
    Returns:
        list: New list with even numbers removed
    """
    return [x for x in l if x % 2 != 0]
```

The first version modifies the original list in place (similar to the original intent but without the iteration bug), while the second version creates and returns a new list without modifying the original.
