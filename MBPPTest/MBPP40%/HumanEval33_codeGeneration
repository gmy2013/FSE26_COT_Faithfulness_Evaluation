CodeGeneration:
+ 2^4 + ... + n^4).

Therefore, we can compute the sum more efficiently by using the formula for the sum of fourth powers and then multiplying by 16.

The formula for the sum of fourth powers is: 
S = n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n²+3n-1)/30

So the function can be implemented as:

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the fourth powers of the first n even numbers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of even numbers to consider
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of the fourth powers of the first n even numbers
    """
    # Using the formula: 16 * (sum of fourth powers from 1 to n)
    # Sum of fourth powers formula: n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n²+3n-1)/30
    sum_fourth_powers = n * (n + 1) * (2*n + 1) * (3*n*n + 3*n - 1) // 30
    return 16 * sum_fourth_powers
```

This implementation is more efficient than the iterative approach as it calculates the result in constant time O(1) rather than O(n).
