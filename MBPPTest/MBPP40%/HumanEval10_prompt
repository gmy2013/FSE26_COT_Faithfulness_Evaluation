The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function aims to find the maximum value in the Nth position across all sublists within test_list.

2. **Input Understanding**: 
   - test_list: A list containing sublists (each sublist has at least N+1 elements)
   - N: An integer index specifying which position in each sublist to examine

3. **Core Logic Breakdown**:
   - Extract all Nth elements from eac
