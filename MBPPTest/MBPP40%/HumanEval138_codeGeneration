CodeGeneration:
ation might not always yield the smallest `m` because:
   - The approximation `T_m ≈ m²/2` is not exact.
   - Rounding might sometimes give a value that is slightly too low.

To ensure correctness, we should compute the actual triangular number for the candidate `m` and verify it has at least `n` digits. If not, we increment `m` until it does.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def find_Index(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1  # T_1 = 1 has 1 digit
    # Compute initial approximation
    m_approx = math.isqrt(2 * (10 ** (n-1)))
    # Start from the floor to be safe, but we use the approximation as a starting point
    m = m_approx
    while True:
        T_m = m * (m + 1) // 2
        if T_m >= 10 ** (n - 1):  # Check if T_m has at least n digits
            return m
        m += 1
```

This code first computes an approximate `m` using the square root, then checks the actual triangular number to ensure it meets the digit requirement. If not, it increments `m` until it does. This guarantees we find the smallest such `m`.
