CodeGeneration:
mpare the list to its reverse sorted version.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def decreasing_trend(nums):
    """Check if the list of numbers is in strictly decreasing order.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of numbers
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the list is strictly decreasing, False otherwise
    """
    return nums == sorted(nums, reverse=True)
```

This implementation:
1. Sorts the list in reverse (descending) order using `sorted(nums, reverse=True)`
2. Compares the original list with this reverse-sorted version
3. Returns `True` only if they are identical, meaning the original list was already in strictly decreasing order
