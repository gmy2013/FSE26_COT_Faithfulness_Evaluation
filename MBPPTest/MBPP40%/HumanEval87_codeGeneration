CodeGeneration:
(abs) of the complex number is calculated using `abs(cn)`, which gives the magnitude (length) of the complex number.
4. The magnitude is returned.

The function is already complete and correct. No changes are needed.

```python
import cmath

def len_complex(a, b):
    cn = complex(a, b)
    length = abs(cn)
    return length
```
