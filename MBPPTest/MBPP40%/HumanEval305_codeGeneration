4. The function returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the year, month, and day found in the URL.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import re

def extract_date(url):
    """
    Extract date components from a URL that contains a date in the format /YYYY/MM/DD/
    
    Args:
        url (str): The URL string to search for date patterns
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains (year, month, day) strings
              Returns an empty list if no matches are found
    """
    return re.findall(r'/(\d{4})/(\d{1,2})/(\d{1,2})/', url)
```

Example usage:
```python
url = "https://example.com/blog/2023/12/25/christmas-post/"
print(extract_date(url))  # Output: [('2023', '12', '25')]

url2 = "https://example.com/archive/2022/1/5/some-post/2023/8/15/another-post/"
print(extract_date(url2))  # Output: [('2022', '1', '5'), ('2023', '8', '15')]

url3 = "https://example.com/no-date-here/"
print(extract_date(url3))  # Output: []
```
