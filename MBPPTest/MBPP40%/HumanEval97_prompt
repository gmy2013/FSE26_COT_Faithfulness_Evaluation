The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `sort_dict_item` takes a dictionary `test_dict` and returns a new dictionary with keys sorted based on a custom sorting criterion.

2. **Key Sorting Mechanism**: 
   - The keys are sorted using `sorted(test_dict.keys(), key = lambda ele: ele[1] * ele[0])`
   - This implies that each key is expected to be a tuple or sequence with at least two elements (index 0 and 1)
   - The sorting key multiplies the first element (index 0) by the second element (index 1) of each key

3. **Dictionary Reconstruction**:
