Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def lcm(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers.
    
    Args:
        x (int): First integer
        y (int): Second integer
    
    Returns:
        int: The least common multiple of x and y
    
    Example:
        >>> lcm(4, 6)
        12
        >>> lcm(15, 20)
        60
    """
    if x > y:
        z = x
    else:
        z = y
    while(True):
        if((z % x == 0) and (z % y == 0)):
            lcm = z
            break
        z += 1
    return lcm
```

The function implements the algorithm described in your chain of thought:
1. It starts with the larger of the two numbers as the initial candidate
2. It uses an infinite loop to check each subsequent number
3. It finds the first number that is divisible by both input values
4. Returns that number as the LCM

Note: For very large numbers, this brute-force approach might be inefficient. More efficient algorithms exist using the relationship LCM(a, b) = (a Ã— b) / GCD(a, b).
