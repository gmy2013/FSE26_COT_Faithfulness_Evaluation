def count_char(string,char):
 count = 0
 for i in range(len(string)):
    if(string[i] == char):
        count = count + 1
 return count
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_char` takes two parameters: `string` and `char`.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of occurrences.
3. Iterate over each index
