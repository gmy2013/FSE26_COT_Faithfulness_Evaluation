The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function is named `last_Two_Digits(N)` and aims to compute the last two digits of N! (factorial of N).
2. There is a condition: `if (N >= 10): return`. This returns `None` for N >= 10, which seems incorrect because we should compute last two digits for any N.
3. The loop calculates factorial modulo 100 (which gives last two digits) for numbers from 1 to N.
4. However, the condition restricts it to only N < 10. For N=10 and above, it returns early without computing.

This is problematic because we should be able to compute last two digits for larger N (e.g., 10! = 3628800, la
