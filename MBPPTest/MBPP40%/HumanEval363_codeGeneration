CodeGeneration:
immediately returns `False`.
7. This means the function only checks the first word and doesn't process the rest of the words in the string.

The function should return `True` if ANY word in the string has even length, not just the first word. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def word_len(s):
    """
    Returns True if any word in the string has even length, False otherwise.
    
    Args:
        s (str): Input string containing words separated by spaces
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if any word has even length, False if all words have odd length
    """
    s = s.split(' ')
    for word in s:
        if len(word) % 2 == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the `else` clause that returned `False` immediately
2. Added a `return False` after the loop completes
3. This ensures all words are checked, and only returns `False` if no even-length words are found
