CodeGeneration:
e the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i]
5. Add this difference to the running sum
6. Return the total sum after processing all elements

Here's the complete function:

```python
def find_Min_Sum(a, b, n):
    """
    Find the minimum sum of absolute differences between elements of two arrays.
    
    Args:
        a (list): First array of integers
        b (list): Second array of integers
        n (int): Number of elements to consider from each array
    
    Returns:
        int: Minimum sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements
    """
    a.sort()
    b.sort()
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
        sum = sum + abs(a[i] - b[i])
    return sum
```
