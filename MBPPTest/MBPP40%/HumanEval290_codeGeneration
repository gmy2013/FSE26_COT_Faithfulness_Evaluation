CodeGeneration:
should use integer division (//) instead of regular division (/) to ensure we are working with integers and avoid floating-point precision issues.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def same_Length(A, B):
    """
    Check if two integers A and B have the same number of digits.

    Args:
        A (int): First integer
        B (int): Second integer

    Returns:
        bool: True if A and B have the same number of digits, False otherwise
    """
    while (A > 0 and B > 0):
        A = A // 10
        B = B // 10
    if (A == 0 and B == 0):
        return True
    return False
```

The key changes:
1. Replaced `/` with `//` (integer division)
2. Added proper docstring documentation
3. Removed unnecessary semicolons (Python doesn't require them)
4. Added type hints and parameter descriptions

This version correctly handles integer inputs and accurately determines if they have the same number of digits by counting how many times each number can be divided by 10 before reaching zero.
