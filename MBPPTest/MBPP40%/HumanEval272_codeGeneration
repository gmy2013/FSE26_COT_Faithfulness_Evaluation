CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected and improved implementation of the Fibonacci function:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
    
    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
    F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 2
    
    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (must be positive integer)
    
    Returns:
        int: The nth Fibonacci number
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is not a positive integer
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

**Key improvements made:**
- Added proper input validation to ensure `n` is a positive integer
- Added comprehensive docstring explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and error handling
- Fixed the parentheses placement in the recursive call (removed extra parentheses around `fibonacci(n - 2)`)
- Maintained the same recursive logic while making it more robust

**Note:** While this recursive implementation is mathematically correct, it has exponential time complexity O(2^n). For practical use with larger values of n, consider using iterative approaches or memoization for better performance.
