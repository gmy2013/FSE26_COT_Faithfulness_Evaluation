Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def Convert(string):
    """
    Converts a string into a list of words by splitting on spaces.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The input string to be converted
        
    Returns:
        list: A list containing the words from the input string
    """
    li = list(string.split(" "))
    return li
```

The function takes a string, splits it into words using spaces as delimiters, and returns the resulting list.
