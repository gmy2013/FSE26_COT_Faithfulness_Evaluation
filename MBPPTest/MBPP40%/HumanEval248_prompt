The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `Sum(N)` computes the sum of all distinct prime divisors of the number `N`.
2. It uses a sieve-like approach (similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes) to precompute an array `SumOfPrimeDivisors` of size `N+1`.
3. For each index `i` from 2 to `N`:
   - If `SumOfPrimeDivisors[i] == 0`, it means `i` is prime (because no prime divisor has been added to it yet).
   - Then, for every multiple `j` of `i` (i.e., `j = i, 2i, 3i, ...` up to `N`), add `i` to `SumOfP
