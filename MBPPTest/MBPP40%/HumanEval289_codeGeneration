CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought and the given function signature, here's the complete implementation:

```python
def find_Extra(arr1, arr2, n):
    """
    Find the index position where two arrays first differ.
    
    Parameters:
    arr1 (list): First array (longer array with n+1 elements)
    arr2 (list): Second array (shorter array with n elements)
    n (int): Length of the shorter array (arr2)
    
    Returns:
    int: Index of the first differing element, or n if all elements match
    """
    for i in range(0, n):
        if arr1[i] != arr2[i]:
            return i
    return n
```

This implementation follows the chain of thought by:
1. Using a linear search approach to compare elements at each index
2. Iterating through indices 0 to n-1 (using `range(0, n)`)
3. Returning the index where elements first differ
4. Returning `n` if all elements in the shorter array match the corresponding elements in the longer array, indicating the extra element is at the end of arr1
