4. The string is split into words using `split()`.
5. An `OrderedDict` is created with words as both keys and values (the value doesn't matter for deduplication).
6. The keys of the OrderedDict (unique words in order) are joined back into a string with spaces.

Here's the complete function with improved readability:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def remove_duplicate(string):
    """
    Remove duplicate words from a string while preserving the order of first occurrences.
    
    Args:
        string (str): Input string containing words separated by spaces
        
    Returns:
        str: String with duplicate words removed, maintaining original order
        
    Example:
        >>> remove_duplicate("hello world hello again")
        'hello world again'
    """
    # Split string into words, use OrderedDict to remove duplicates while preserving order
    unique_words = OrderedDict.fromkeys(string.split())
    # Join the unique words back into a string
    result = ' '.join(unique_words.keys())
    return result
```

This implementation:
- Uses the more efficient `OrderedDict.fromkeys()` method
- Maintains the original order of first occurrences
- Properly handles words separated by spaces
- Returns the deduplicated string with single spaces between words
