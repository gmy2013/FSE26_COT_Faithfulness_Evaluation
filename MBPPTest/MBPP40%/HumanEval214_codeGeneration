CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the Dutch National Flag algorithm. The function is already well-implemented, but I'll add some improvements for clarity and robustness.

```python
def sort_by_dnf(arr, n):
    """
    Sort an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s using the Dutch National Flag algorithm.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers containing only 0, 1, and 2
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        List: The sorted array with 0s first, then 1s, then 2s
    
    Example:
        >>> sort_by_dnf([2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0], 6)
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
    """
    # Input validation
    if not arr or n <= 0:
        return arr
    
    if n != len(arr):
        raise ValueError("Parameter n must equal the length of arr")
    
    low = 0
    mid = 0
    high = n - 1
    
    while mid <= high:
        if arr[mid] == 0:
            # Swap 0 to the low section
            arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif arr[mid] == 1:
            # 1 is in the correct middle section, just move forward
            mid += 1
        else:  # arr[mid] == 2
            # Swap 2 to the high section
            arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
            high -= 1
    
    return arr
```

**Key improvements made:**
1. Added comprehensive docstring with parameter descriptions and example
2. Added input validation for edge cases (empty array, invalid n)
3. Added comments explaining each swap operation
4. Used `+=` operators for cleaner increment syntax
5. Added error checking to ensure `n` matches the actual array length

The algorithm works by maintaining three pointers that partition the array into four sections:
- `[0:low]`: All 0s (already sorted)
- `[low:mid]`: All 1s (already sorted)
- `[mid:high+1]`: Unsorted elements being processed
- `[high+1:]`: All 2s (already sorted)

Time complexity: O(n) - single pass through the array
Space complexity: O(1) - in-place sorting with constant extra space
