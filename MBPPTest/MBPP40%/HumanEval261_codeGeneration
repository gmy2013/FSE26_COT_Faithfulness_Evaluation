Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def n_common_words(text, n):
    """
    Returns the n most common words in the given text.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input text to analyze
        n (int): The number of most common words to return
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples containing the n most common words and their counts,
              sorted by frequency in descending order
    """
    words = re.findall('\w+', text)
    n_common_words = Counter(words).most_common(n)
    return list(n_common_words)
```

The function:
1. Uses regex to find all words (sequences of alphanumeric characters) in the input text
2. Creates a Counter object to count word frequencies
3. Uses `most_common(n)` to get the top n words by frequency
4. Returns the result as a list of tuples where each tuple contains (word, count)
