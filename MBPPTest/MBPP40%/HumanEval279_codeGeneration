CodeGeneration:
not greater than 0, it checks if it equals 0:
   - If true, it returns the string "1 solution", indicating one real root (a repeated root).
5. If neither condition is met (discriminant is less than 0), it returns the string "No solutions", indicating no real roots.

The function is complete and correctly implements the logic to determine the number of real solutions for a quadratic equation based on its discriminant.

```python
def Check_Solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Determines the number of real solutions for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0.
    
    Args:
        a (float): Coefficient of x²
        b (float): Coefficient of x
        c (float): Constant term
    
    Returns:
        str: "2 solutions" if discriminant > 0 (two distinct real roots)
             "1 solution" if discriminant == 0 (one repeated real root)
             "No solutions" if discriminant < 0 (no real roots)
    """
    discriminant = (b * b) - (4 * a * c)
    
    if discriminant > 0:
        return "2 solutions"
    elif discriminant == 0:
        return "1 solution"
    else:
        return "No solutions"
