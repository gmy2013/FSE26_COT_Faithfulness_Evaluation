def remove_even(l):
    for i in l:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            l.remove(i)
    return l
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_even(l)` aims to remove all even integers from the list `l`.
2. The current implementation uses a for-loop to iterate over each element `i` in the list.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`). If true, it removes `i` from the list using `l.remove(i)`.
4. However, modifying a list while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior because the iteration index gets disrupted when elements are removed.
5. For example, if two consecutive even numbers exist, the second might be skipped because the list shifts after removal.
6. A better approach is to create a new list containing only the odd elements (i.e., elements where `i % 2 != 0`).
7. Alternatively, we can use a list comprehension to filter out even numbers efficiently and without side effects.
8. The improved function should return a new list with only odd numbers, preserving the original list if needed.
