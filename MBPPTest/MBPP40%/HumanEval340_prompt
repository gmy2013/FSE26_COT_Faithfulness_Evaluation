def count_elim(num):
  count_elim = 0
  for n in num:
    if isinstance(n, tuple):

    count_elim += 1
  return count_elim
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_elim` takes a parameter `num`, which is expected to be an iterable (likely a list or tuple).
2. Initialize a counter `count_elim` to 0 to keep track of the number of elements processed.
3. Iterate over each element `n` in the input `num`.
4. For each element, check if it is an instance of `tuple` usi
