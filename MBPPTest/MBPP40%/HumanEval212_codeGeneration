CodeGeneration:
```python
def string_length(str1):
    count = 0
    for char in str1:
        count += 1
    return count
```

The function correctly calculates the length of a string by iterating through each character and incrementing a counter. This implementation manually counts characters rather than using Python's built-in `len()` function, which would be the more efficient approach:

```python
def string_length(str1):
    return len(str1)
```

However, the provided implementation works correctly and demonstrates the underlying mechanism of how string length calculation works.
