CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and your chain of thought:

```python
def first_repeated_char(str1):
  """
  Identify the first repeated character in a string.
  
  Args:
      str1 (str): The input string to search for repeated characters
  
  Returns:
      str: The first repeated character found, or "None" if no repeats exist
  """
  for index, c in enumerate(str1):
    if str1[:index+1].count(c) > 1:
      return c 
  return "None"
```

**Explanation of the implementation:**
- The function iterates through each character in the string using `enumerate()` to track both the character and its index
- For each character at position `index`, it checks if that character appears more than once in the substring from the start up to and including the current position
- If a character is found that repeats within this substring, it returns that character immediately
- If no repeated characters are found after checking all positions, it returns "None"

**Example usage:**
```python
print(first_repeated_char("hello"))    # Returns 'l'
print(first_repeated_char("python"))   # Returns "None"
print(first_repeated_char("abracadabra"))  # Returns 'a'
```
