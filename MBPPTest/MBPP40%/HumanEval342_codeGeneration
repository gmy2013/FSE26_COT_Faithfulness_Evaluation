Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
from heapq import merge

def combine_lists(num1, num2):
    """
    Combine two sorted lists into a single sorted list using heapq.merge.
    
    This function takes two sorted lists and returns a new sorted list that
    contains all elements from both input lists in ascending order.
    
    Args:
        num1 (list): First sorted list of numbers
        num2 (list): Second sorted list of numbers
    
    Returns:
        list: A new sorted list containing all elements from both input lists
    
    Example:
        >>> combine_lists([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        >>> combine_lists([-5, 0, 10], [-3, 7, 15])
        [-5, -3, 0, 7, 10, 15]
    """
    combine_lists = list(merge(num1, num2))
    return combine_lists
```

The function uses `heapq.merge()` which efficiently merges multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output. It returns an iterator, so we convert it to a list before returning. This approach has O(n) time complexity where n is the total number of elements in both lists.
