The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the check_Even_Parity function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function checks if a number has even parity (even number of 1 bits in its binary representation)
2. **Initialization**: Start with parity counter at 0
3. **Bit Counting Loop**: 
   - Use Brian Kernighan's algorithm: x & (x-
