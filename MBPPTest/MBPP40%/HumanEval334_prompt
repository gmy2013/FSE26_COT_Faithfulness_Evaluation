def series_sum(number):
 total = 0
 total = (number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1)) / 6
 return total
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function calculates the sum of squares of the first `number` natural numbers.
2. The formula for the sum of squares is: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
3. The implementation correctly applies
