CodeGeneration:
Based on the incomplete docstring context, I'll provide a corrected implementation that properly zips two lists into sublists:

```python
def zip_list(list1, list2):
    """
    Zips two lists by combining corresponding elements into sublists.
    
    Args:
        list1: First list to zip
        list2: Second list to zip
        
    Returns:
        list: A list where each element is a sublist containing corresponding
              elements from list1 and list2
        
    Example:
        >>> zip_list([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'])
        [[1, 'a'], [2, 'b'], [3, 'c']]
    """
    result = list(map(lambda x, y: [x, y], list1, list2))
    return result
```

The key changes:
- Replaced `list.__add__` with a lambda function `lambda x, y: [x, y]` which properly creates sublists
- This works with any data types, not just lists
- Added complete docstring with proper documentation
- The function now correctly zips elements into sublists rather than concatenating them
