def multiply_elements(test_tup):
  res = tuple(i * j for i, j in zip(test_tup, test_tup[1:]))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `multiply_elements` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
2. The goal is to create a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive pairs in the original tuple.
3. To achieve this, we use `zip(test_tup, test_t
