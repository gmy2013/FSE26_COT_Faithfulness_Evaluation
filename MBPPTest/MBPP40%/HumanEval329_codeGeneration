CodeGeneration:
ll match:
   - The string "a" (with zero 'b's)
   - The string "ab" (with one 'b')
   - The string "abb" (with two 'b's), etc.
   But it will match the minimal number of 'b's possible.

4. The function returns 'Found a match!' if the pattern is found anywhere in the text, otherwise 'Not matched!'.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import re
def text_match(text):
        patterns = 'ab*?'
        if re.search(patterns,  text):
                return ('Found a match!')
        else:
                return ('Not matched!')
```
