The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `sum_even_odd` takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of the first even and first odd numbers found.

2. **First Even Number Extraction**: 
   - Uses a generator expression with `next()` to find the first element where `el % 2 == 0` (even number)
   - Returns `-1` as default if no even number is found

3. **First Odd Number Extraction**:
   - Uses a gene
