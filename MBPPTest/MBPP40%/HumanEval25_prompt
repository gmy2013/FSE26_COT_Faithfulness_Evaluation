def triangle_area(r) :  
    if r < 0 : 
        return -1
    return r * r 
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze this function step by step:

1. The function is named `triangle_area(r)` but calculates `r * r` which is the area of a square, not a triangle
2. The area of a triangle should be (base Ã— height)/2
3. The function returns -1 for negative inputs, which is good error handling
4. The func
