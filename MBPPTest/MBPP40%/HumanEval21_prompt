The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Initialize variables**: Set pointers i and j to track positions in arr1 and arr2, m1 and m2 to track median candidates, and count to track iterations.

2. **Loop until median is found**: Iterate n+1 times since we need to find two middle elements for the median calculation.

3. **Handle edge cases**: 
   - If arr1 is exhausted (i == n), set m1 to previous m2 and m2 to f
