CodeGeneration:
ne equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3)/4 * side²). Since there are 4 faces, the total surface area is 4 * (sqrt(3)/4 * side²) = sqrt(3) * side².

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import math

def area_tetrahedron(side):
    """Calculate the surface area of a regular tetrahedron.
    
    Args:
        side (float): Length of one side of the tetrahedron
        
    Returns:
        float: Total surface area of the tetrahedron
    """
    area = math.sqrt(3) * (side ** 2)
    return area
```
