The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_Rotation` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as parameters.
2. The goal is to find the number of rotations needed to sort the array in ascending order.
3. Since the array is rotated, the minimum element's index indicates the rotation count.
4. Iterate from ind
