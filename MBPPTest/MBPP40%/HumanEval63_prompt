The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing and improving the given function:

1. **Identify the function's purpose**: The function calculates the average of even numbers from n down to 2

2. **Analyze the current implementation**:
   - Input validation: Checks if n is even, returns error message and -1
   - Sum calculation: Uses while loop to sum even numbers from n down to 2
   - Count tracking: Counts how many even numbers are processed
   - Return: Uses integer division to return the average

3. **Identify issues in current code
