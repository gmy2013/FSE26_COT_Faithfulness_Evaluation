from collections import Counter
def count_variable(a,b,c,d):

  return list(c.elements())
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_variable` takes four arguments: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
2. It creates a `Counter` object with keys 'p', 'q', 'r', 's' mapped to the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` respectively.
3. The `Counter` object `c` will count the occurrences of each key based on the integer value provided (each value should be a non-negative in
