CodeGeneration:
```python
def merge(lst):
    """Transpose a list of lists (convert rows to columns).
    
    Args:
        lst: A list of lists (matrix) to be transposed
        
    Returns:
        A new list of lists where rows become columns and columns become rows
        
    Example:
        >>> merge([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
        [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
    """
    return [list(ele) for ele in list(zip(*lst))]
```

The function correctly transposes the input list of lists by:
1. Using `*lst` to unpack the sublists as arguments to `zip()`
2. `zip()` pairs elements from each sublist by their positions
3. Converting each tuple from `zip()` to a list
4. Returning the transposed matrix as a new list of lists
