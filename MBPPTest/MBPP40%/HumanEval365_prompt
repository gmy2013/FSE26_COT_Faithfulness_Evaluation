   tuple1 = [t for t in tuple1 if t]

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_empty` takes a tuple `tuple1` as input.
2. The goal is to remove any empty tuples or tuples that contain only empty strings.
3. The provided solution uses a list comprehension to filter the input.
4. The condition `if t` checks for truthiness: 
   - An empty tuple `()` is falsy, so it will be filtered out.
   - A tuple containing an empty string `('',)` is truthy (because the tuple itself is non-empty), so it would not be removed. This does not match the intended behavior from the comment.
