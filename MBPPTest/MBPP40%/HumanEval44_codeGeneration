iven list.
3. In `find_k_product`, we extract the K-th element from each sublist in `test_list` and compute the product of these elements using `get_product`.
4. Finally, it returns the computed product.

Here is the complete code with the docstring:

```python
def get_product(val):
    """Compute the product of all elements in the given list.
    
    Args:
        val (list): List of numbers to multiply.
    
    Returns:
        int/float: The product of all elements in the list.
    """
    res = 1
    for ele in val:
        res *= ele
    return res

def find_k_product(test_list, K):
    """Find the product of K-th elements from each sublist in the given list.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): List of sublists containing numbers.
        K (int): Index of the element to extract from each sublist.
    
    Returns:
        int/float: Product of all K-th elements from the sublists.
    
    Example:
        >>> find_k_product([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 1)
        80  # because 2 * 5 * 8 = 80
    """
    res = get_product([sub[K] for sub in test_list])
    return res
```
