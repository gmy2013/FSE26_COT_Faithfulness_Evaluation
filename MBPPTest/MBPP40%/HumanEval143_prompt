def check_none(test_tup):
  res = any(map(lambda ele: ele is None, test_tup))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `check_none` is designed to check if any element in a tuple is `None`

2. **Input Parameter**: The function takes one parameter `test_tup`, which is expected to be a tuple

3. **Core Logic Breakdown**:
   - `map(lambda ele: ele is None, test_tup)` applies a lambda function to each element in the tuple
   - The lambda function checks if each element `ele` is equal to `None` using the identi
