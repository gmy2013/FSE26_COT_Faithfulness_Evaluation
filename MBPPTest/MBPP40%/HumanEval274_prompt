def min_difference(test_list):
  temp = [abs(b - a) for a, b in test_list]
  res = min(temp)
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing and improving the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function aims to find the minimum absolute difference between pairs in a list of tuples.

2. **Current Implementation Review**: 
   - The function takes `test_list` as input
   - It creates a list `temp` using list comprehension that calculates absolute differences between `b` and `a` for each tuple `(a, b)` in `test_list`
   - It finds the minimum value in `temp` and returns it

3. **Potential Issues Identified**:
   - The
