CodeGeneration:
rectly identifies odd numbers.
4. Confirm the default value `-1` is returned when no odd numbers are found.
5. The implementation is correct and efficient as it stops at the first match.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def first_odd(nums):
    """Return the first odd number in the list.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers to search through
        
    Returns:
        First odd number found in the list, or -1 if no odd numbers exist
    """
    first_odd = next((el for el in nums if el%2!=0), -1)
    return first_odd
```
