CodeGeneration:
tion name suggests it should calculate the area of a triangle, but the implementation calculates the area of a square
5. The function should be corrected to calculate the area of a triangle
6. Since the function takes only one parameter `r`, this likely represents the base of the triangle
7. However, to calculate triangle area, we need both base and height
8. The function name might be misleading, or perhaps `r` represents something else
9. Looking at the context, maybe `r` represents the radius of an inscribed circle or some other geometric property
10. Without more context, I'll assume the function should calculate the area of an equilateral triangle where `r` is the side length
11. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length `r` is (√3/4) × r²

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(r):
    """
    Calculate the area of an equilateral triangle with side length r.
    
    Args:
        r (float): The side length of the equilateral triangle
        
    Returns:
        float: The area of the triangle, or -1 if r is negative
    """
    if r < 0:
        return -1
    return (math.sqrt(3) / 4) * r * r
```
