The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the max_chain_length function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function finds the longest chain of pairs where each subsequent pair's first element is greater than the previous pair's second element.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - Initialize `max` to 0 to track the maximum chain length found
   - Create `mcl` (maximum chain length) array with initial value 1 for each element (each pair forms a chain of length 1 by itself)

3. **Dynamic Prog
