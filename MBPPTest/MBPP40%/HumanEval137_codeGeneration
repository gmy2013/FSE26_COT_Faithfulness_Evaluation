CodeGeneration:
I see you've provided a function and started a chain of thought. Based on your analysis, I can see that the function implements a recursive geometric series sum. Let me complete the implementation with proper documentation:

```python
def geometric_sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of a geometric series with ratio 1/2 from n=0 to the given n.
    
    The series is: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^n)
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit of the series (non-negative integer)
        
    Returns:
        float: The sum of the geometric series from 0 to n
        
    Examples:
        >>> geometric_sum(0)
        1.0
        >>> geometric_sum(1)
        1.5
        >>> geometric_sum(2)
        1.75
        >>> geometric_sum(3)
        1.875
    """
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 / (pow(2, n)) + geometric_sum(n - 1)
```

The function correctly implements the geometric series sum using recursion. The base case handles negative inputs by returning 0, and the recursive case adds the current term (1/2^n) to the sum of all previous terms.

Note: For large values of n, this recursive approach may hit Python's recursion limit. For production use, an iterative approach might be more efficient for large n values.
