CodeGeneration:
The function `remove_char(S)` removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string `S` by using a regular expression pattern that matches any non-word character (including underscores) and replaces them with empty strings.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import re 

def remove_char(S):
    """
    Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string.
    
    Args:
        S (str): Input string that may contain non-alphanumeric characters
    
    Returns:
        str: String with all non-alphanumeric characters removed
    
    Examples:
        >>> remove_char("Hello, World! 123")
        'HelloWorld123'
        >>> remove_char("test@example.com")
        'testexamplecom'
        >>> remove_char("abc_123-def")
        'abc123def'
    """
    result = re.sub('[\W_]+', '', S) 
    return result
```

The regex pattern `[\W_]+` works as follows:
- `\W` matches any non-word character (equivalent to `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`)
- `_` explicitly matches underscores
- The `+` means "one or more occurrences"
- Together, `[\W_]+` matches any sequence of non-alphanumeric characters including underscores

This function effectively removes all punctuation, whitespace, symbols, and underscores from the input string, leaving only alphanumeric characters.
