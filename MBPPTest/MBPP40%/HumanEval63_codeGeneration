CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought analysis, here's the improved implementation:

```python
def average_Even(n):
    """
    Calculate the average of even numbers from n down to 2.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The starting even number (must be even and positive)
    
    Returns:
        float: The average of even numbers from n down to 2
        str: "Invalid Input" if n is not even or positive
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is not even or positive
    """
    if n <= 0 or n % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid Input: n must be a positive even number")
    
    total = 0
    count = 0
    current = n
    
    while current >= 2:
        total += current
        count += 1
        current -= 2
    
    return total / count
```

Key improvements made:
- Fixed the unreachable `return -1` statement
- Added validation for positive numbers
- Changed to return float division instead of integer division
- Used more descriptive variable names
- Added proper docstring with parameter and return type documentation
- Used exception handling instead of returning mixed types
- Removed unnecessary parentheses in conditionals
- Added proper error handling with ValueError exception
