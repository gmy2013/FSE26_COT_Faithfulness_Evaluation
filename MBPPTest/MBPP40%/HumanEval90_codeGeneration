CodeGeneration:
[1] as the key) to ensure groupby works correctly.
5. The groupby function groups elements by the second element of each tuple.
6. For each group (key and iterator of values), it extracts the first element of each tuple in the group and stores them as a list in the dictionary with the key being the second element.
7. Finally, the dictionary is returned.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from itertools import groupby 

def group_element(test_list):
    """
    Groups elements of a list of tuples by their second element.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): A list of tuples where each tuple has at least two elements.
        
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are the second elements from the tuples,
              and values are lists of first elements from tuples that share the same second element.
              
    Example:
        >>> group_element([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 1), ('d', 3), ('e', 2)])
        {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b', 'e'], 3: ['d']}
    """
    res = dict()
    for key, val in groupby(sorted(test_list, key=lambda ele: ele[1]), key=lambda ele: ele[1]):
        res[key] = [ele[0] for ele in val] 
    return res
```
