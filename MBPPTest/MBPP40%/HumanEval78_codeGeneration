CodeGeneration:
ing `list(ditionary)`, then returns the key at the specified index.
3. However, note that the parameter name is misspelled as `ditionary` instead of `dictionary`. This should be corrected for clarity.
4. Also, the function should handle cases where the key index is out of range. Currently, it would raise an `IndexError` if the index is invalid.
5. We can improve the function by adding error handling for the index and the input type.

Here is the corrected and improved version of the function:

```python
def access_key(dictionary, key):
    """
    Access a key from the dictionary by its index.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access a key from.
        key (int): The index of the key to retrieve.

    Returns:
        The key at the given index.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a dictionary or the key is not an integer.
        IndexError: If the key index is out of range.
    """
    if not isinstance(dictionary, dict):
        raise TypeError("First argument must be a dictionary.")
    if not isinstance(key, int):
        raise TypeError("Key index must be an integer.")
    
    keys = list(dictionary)
    if key < 0 or key >= len(keys):
        raise IndexError("Key index out of range.")
    
    return keys[key]
```
