def same_Length(A,B): 
    while (A > 0 and B > 0): 
        A = A / 10; 
        B = B / 10; 
    if (A == 0 and B == 0):

    return False; 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `same_Length` is intended to check if two integers `A` and `B` have the same number of digits.
2. The current implementation uses a while loop that divides both numbers by 10 until at least one becomes zero.
3. After the loop, it checks if both numbers are exactly zero to return True, otherwise False.
4. However, this approach has a flaw: dividing integers by 10 in Python may result in floats (e.g., 1/10 becomes 0.1), which can cause incorrect comparisons.
5. To fix this, i
