Here's the corrected function with improved logic and documentation:

```python
def arc_length(d, a):
    """
    Calculate the arc length of a circle sector.
    
    Args:
        d (float): Diameter of the circle
        a (float): Angle of the sector in degrees
    
    Returns:
        float: Arc length of the sector, or None if angle is 360 degrees or more
    """
    pi = 22/7
    
    # Check if angle is 360 degrees or more (full circle or invalid)
    if a >= 360:
        return None
    
    # Calculate arc length: (circumference) * (angle/360)
    arclength = (pi * d) * (a / 360)
    return arclength
```

The function:
1. Takes diameter `d` and angle `a` (in degrees) as input
2. Returns `None` if the angle is 360° or more (since this would represent a full circle or invalid sector)
3. Calculates the arc length using the formula: (π × diameter) × (angle/360)
4. Uses the approximation π ≈ 22/7 as specified

The function correctly handles the case where the angle is exactly 360° by returning `None`, as this would represent the full circumference rather than an arc segment.
