Looking at the function, I can see it correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` odd numbers. However, I can suggest a more efficient approach using a mathematical formula.

The sum of cubes of the first `n` odd numbers can be calculated directly with the formula: `n² * (2n² - 1)`

Here's an optimized version:

```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of odd numbers to include in the sum
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of cubes of first n odd numbers
    
    Formula: n² * (2n² - 1)
    """
    return n * n * (2 * n * n - 1)
```

This version:
1. Uses the direct mathematical formula instead of a loop
2. Has O(1) time complexity instead of O(n)
3. Is more efficient for large values of n
4. Produces identical results to the original function

Both implementations will give the same results:
- cube_Sum(1) = 1
- cube_Sum(2) = 1 + 27 = 28
- cube_Sum(3) = 1 + 27 + 125 = 153
- cube_Sum(4) = 1 + 27 + 125 + 343 = 496
