CodeGeneration:
t calculates the difference between `actual_cost` and `sale_amount` and returns that amount.
4. If false (meaning `actual_cost` is less than or equal to `sale_amount`), it returns `None` since there is no profit.

The function is already complete and correctly implements the described logic. Here's the code again for clarity:

```python
def profit_amount(actual_cost, sale_amount):
    if actual_cost > sale_amount:
        amount = actual_cost - sale_amount
        return amount
    else:
        return None
```
