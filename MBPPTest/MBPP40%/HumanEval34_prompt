import heapq as hq
def heap_sort(iterable):
    h = []
    for value in iterable:
        hq.heappush(h, value)
    return [hq.heappop(h) for i in range(len(h))]
The following is chain of thought:
1. Initialize an empty list `h` to serve as the heap.
2. Iterate through each element in the input `iterable`.
3. For each element, push it onto the heap using `heapq.heappush`, which maintain
