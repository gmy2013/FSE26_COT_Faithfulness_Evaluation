def check_subset(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = set(test_tup2).issubset(test_tup1)
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for implementing the check_subset function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function needs to check if all elements of test_tup2 are present in test_tup1
2. **Input Type Consideration**: Both inputs are tuples, but set operations require iterable inputs
3. **Set Conversion Strategy**: Con
