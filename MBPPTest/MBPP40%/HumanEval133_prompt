def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr,n):
    ans = 0
    res = 0
    i = n - 1
    while (i >= 0):
        incr = arr[i]*(1 + res)
        ans += incr
        res = incr
        i -= 1
    return (ans)
The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function calculates the sum of products of all contiguous subarrays.
2. It uses a reverse iteration (from last element to first).
3. For each element `arr[i]`, it computes:
   - `incr = arr[i] * (1 + res)`
   - Adds `incr` to the cumulative answer `ans`
   - Updates `res` to be `incr` for the next iteration

Let's break down the logic:
- `res` stores the sum of products of all contiguous subarrays starting at index `i+1` (to the right).
- When we add `arr[i]` to the front, we can form:
   a) The single element `arr[i]` (product = `arr[i]`)
   b) All previ
