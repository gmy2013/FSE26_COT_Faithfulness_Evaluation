Here's the completed function based on the docstring and chain of thought:

```python
def count_Pairs(arr, n):
    """
    Count the number of pairs of equal elements in the array.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): The input array
    n (int): The length of the array
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of pairs where arr[i] == arr[j] for i < j
    """
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

The function counts all pairs of equal elements in the array where the indices satisfy i < j (to avoid counting the same pair twice or counting an element with itself). The nested loops compare each element with all subsequent elements in the array.
