CodeGeneration:
ap Application**: 
   - `map(lambda ele: not ele, test_tup)` applies the lambda to each element
   - This creates an iterator that yields `True` for falsy elements, `False` for truthy ones

4. **Any Function Usage**: 
   - `any(...)` checks if there's at least one `True` in the mapped results
   - This means it returns `True` if any element was falsy (since falsy elements become `True`)

5. **Result Inversion**: 
   - `not any(...)` inverts the result
   - So if `any` found a falsy element (returns `True`), `not` makes it `False`
   - If no falsy elements were found (`any` returns `False`), `not` makes it `True`

6. **Final Result**: The function returns `True` only if all elements are truthy, `False` otherwise

The function is equivalent to `all(test_tup)` but implemented using `any` with negation.
