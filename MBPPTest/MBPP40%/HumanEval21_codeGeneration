CodeGeneration:
irst element of arr2, then break.
   - If arr2 is exhausted (j == n), set m1 to previous m2 and m2 to first element of arr1, then break.

4. **Compare elements**: 
   - If current element in arr1 is smaller or equal, update m1 to m2 and m2 to arr1[i], then increment i.
   - Else, update m1 to m2 and m2 to arr2[j], then increment j.

5. **Calculate median**: After loop, return average of m1 and m2 as median.

Now, here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
    """
    Find the median of two sorted arrays of the same size.
    
    This function uses a two-pointer approach to merge the arrays while tracking
    the two middle elements needed to calculate the median.
    
    Args:
        arr1 (list): First sorted array of size n
        arr2 (list): Second sorted array of size n
        n (int): Size of both arrays
    
    Returns:
        float: Median of the combined sorted arrays
    
    Example:
        >>> get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)
        16.0
    """
    i = 0
    j = 0
    m1 = -1
    m2 = -1
    count = 0
    
    while count < n + 1:
        count += 1
        
        if i == n:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr2[0]
            break
        elif j == n:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr1[0]
            break
            
        if arr1[i] <= arr2[j]:

            m2 = arr1[i]

            m2 = arr2[j]
            j += 1
            
    return (m1 + m2) / 2
