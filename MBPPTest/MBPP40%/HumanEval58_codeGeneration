CodeGeneration:
5. For each pair (i, j), it checks if the elements at these indices are equal and if the element is not already in the `repeated` list.
6. If both conditions are true, it appends the element to `repeated`.
7. Finally, it returns the `repeated` list containing all duplicate elements found.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def Repeat(x):
    """
    Find all duplicate elements in a list.
    
    This function identifies all elements that appear more than once in the input list
    and returns them in the order they were first found as duplicates.
    
    Args:
        x (list): The input list to search for duplicates
        
    Returns:
        list: A list containing all duplicate elements found in the input list
        
    Example:
        >>> Repeat([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4])
        [1, 2, 4]
        >>> Repeat(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b'])
        ['a', 'b']
    """
    _size = len(x) 
    repeated = [] 
    for i in range(_size): 
        k = i + 1
        for j in range(k, _size): 
            if x[i] == x[j] and x[i] not in repeated: 
                repeated.append(x[i]) 
    return repeated
```
