ex since polite numbers start from 3 for n=1).
   - Then compute the inner logarithm: math.log(n, 2) which is logâ‚‚(n).
   - Add this to n: n + math.log(n, 2).
   - Take log base 2 of that result: math.log((n + math.log(n, 2)), 2).
   - Add this to n: n + math.log((n + math.log(n, 2)), 2).
   - Finally, convert to integer to get the nth polite number.

Here is the corrected and completed function:

```python
import math

def is_polite(n):
    """
    Compute the nth polite number.
    
    Polite numbers are positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more
    consecutive positive integers. The formula used is an approximation that becomes
    increasingly accurate for larger n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The index of the polite number to compute (starting from 1).
    
    Returns:
        int: The nth polite number.
    
    Examples:
        >>> is_polite(1)
        3
        >>> is_polite(2)
        5
        >>> is_polite(3)
        6
        >>> is_polite(4)
        7
        >>> is_polite(5)
        9
    """
    n = n + 1
    return int(n + math.log(n + math.log(n, 2), 2))
```
