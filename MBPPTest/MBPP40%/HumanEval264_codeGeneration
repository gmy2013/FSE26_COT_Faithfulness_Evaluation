CodeGeneration:
I see that the chain of thought was cut off, but I can complete the function based on the provided code and docstring.

The function `ntimes_list` takes a list of numbers `nums` and a number `n`, and returns a new list where each element is multiplied by `n`.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def ntimes_list(nums, n):
    """Multiply each element in nums by n and return as a list.
    
    Args:
        nums: A list of numbers
        n: A number to multiply each element by
    
    Returns:
        A new list with each element multiplied by n
    """
    result = map(lambda x: n * x, nums)
    return list(result)
```

**Alternative implementations:**

You could also implement this using:
1. **List comprehension** (more Pythonic):
```python
def ntimes_list(nums, n):
    return [n * x for x in nums]
```

2. **Using a for loop**:
```python
def ntimes_list(nums, n):
    result = []
    for num in nums:
        result.append(n * num)
    return result
```

The original implementation using `map()` with a lambda function is functional, but list comprehensions are generally preferred in Python for their readability.
