def remove_nested(test_tup):
  res = tuple()
  for count, ele in enumerate(test_tup):
    if not isinstance(ele, tuple):
      res = res + (ele, )
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function and its intended behavior:

1. The function is named `remove_nested`, suggesting it should remove nested tuples
2. The current implementation only adds elements to the result if they are NOT tuples
3. This means it removes ALL tuples (both nested and the outer tuple structure)
4. However, the docstring is missing, but based on the function name, it should:
   - Remove nested tuples while preserving the outer tuple structure
   - Keep non-tuple elements intact
   - Flatten the structure by one level
