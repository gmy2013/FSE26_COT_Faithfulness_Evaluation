CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis of the existing code and the chain of thought, I can see that this code generates all possible coordinate combinations where each coordinate value can be ±1 from the original value in the input tuple.

Here's the complete implementation with proper documentation:

```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []):
    """
    Recursive generator function that generates all adjacent coordinate combinations.
    
    Args:
        ele: Tuple of coordinate values
        sub: Current coordinate combination being built (default empty list)
        
    Yields:
        Lists of coordinate values where each value is within ±1 of the original
    """
    if not ele: 
        yield sub 
    else: 
        yield from [idx for j in range(ele[0] - 1, ele[0] + 2) 
                   for idx in adjac(ele[1:], sub + [j])] 

def get_coordinates(test_tup):
    """
    Get all adjacent coordinate combinations for a given tuple of coordinates.
    
    Args:
        test_tup: Tuple of coordinate values
        
    Returns:
        List of all possible coordinate combinations where each value
        can be the original value, one less, or one more
    """
    res = list(adjac(test_tup))
    return (res)
```

**Example usage:**
```python
