The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `product_Equal(n)` checks if the product of digits at odd positions equals the product of digits at even positions.
2. For numbers less than 10 (single-digit), it returns False since there are no two positions to compare.
3. Initialize `prodOdd` and `prodEven` to 1 to accumulate products.
4. Process digits from right to left (least significant digit first):
   - The first digit processed (rightmost) is considered at an odd
