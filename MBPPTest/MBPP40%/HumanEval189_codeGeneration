CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function, I can see it's already implemented correctly to check if every element at index i has the same parity (even/odd) as its index i.

The function uses:
- `all()` to check if all conditions are True
- A generator expression that iterates through all indices
- `nums[i]%2==i%2` to compare the parity of the element and its index

This is a concise and efficient implementation. Here's the complete function:

```python
def even_position(nums):
    return all(nums[i]%2==i%2 for i in range(len(nums)))
```

The function will return:
- `True` if every element at even index is even and every element at odd index is odd
- `False` if any element doesn't match the parity of its index position
