CodeGeneration:
to iterate over the indices of `lst1` (or `lst2` since they are assumed to be the same length) and adds the corresponding elements from both lists.
4. The result is stored in `res_list` and returned.

However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the lists are of different lengths. To make the function more robust, we can add a check to ensure both lists have the same length before proceeding. Alternatively, we can use the `zip` function to handle lists of different lengths by truncating to the shortest list, but the docstring does not specify the expected behavior in such cases. Since the original implementation assumes equal length, we'll maintain that behavior but add a length check for clarity and to avoid potential errors.

Here is the improved version with a length check:

```python
def sum_list(lst1, lst2):
    """
    Sums corresponding elements of two lists.

    Args:
        lst1 (list): The first list of numbers.
        lst2 (list): The second list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in lst1 and lst2.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input lists are not of the same length.
    """
    if len(lst1) != len(lst2):
        raise ValueError("Input lists must be of the same length")
    res_list = [lst1[i] + lst2[i] for i in range(len(lst1))]
    return res_list
```

Alternatively, if we want to handle lists of different lengths by truncating to the shortest list (which might be a common expectation), we can use `zip`:

```python
def sum_list(lst1, lst2):
    """
    Sums corresponding elements of two lists.

    If the lists are of different lengths, the result is truncated to the length of the shorter list.

    Args:
        lst1 (list): The first list of numbers.
        lst2 (list): The second list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in lst1 and lst2.
    """
    res_list = [a + b for a, b in zip(lst1, lst2)]
    return res_list
```

The choice between these two implementations depends on the intended behavior. The first one (with the length check) is stricter and ensures both lists are of the same length, while the second one (using `zip`) is more flexible and handles lists of different lengths by ignoring the extra elements in the longer list.

Since the original implementation did not have a docstring, I provided one for clarity. The function now includes proper documentation and error handling (or flexible behavior) as appropriate.
