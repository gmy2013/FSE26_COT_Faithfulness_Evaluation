CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function with the corrected variable name:

```python
from collections import Counter

def add_dict(d1, d2):
    """
    Combine two dictionaries by adding values of common keys.
    
    Args:
        d1 (dict): First dictionary
        d2 (dict): Second dictionary
        
    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary where values of common keys are summed,
              and all keys from both dictionaries are included.
    """
    result = Counter(d1) + Counter(d2)
    return dict(result)
```

The key improvements:
1. Fixed the variable name conflict (changed `add_dict` to `result`)
2. Converted the Counter object back to a regular dictionary before returning
3. Added proper docstring documentation
4. Maintained the efficient Counter-based approach for summing values of common keys

The function will work correctly, for example:
- `add_dict({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'b': 3, 'c': 4})` returns `{'a': 1, 'b': 5, 'c': 4}`
