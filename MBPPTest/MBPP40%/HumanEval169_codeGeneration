CodeGeneration:
n` (inclusive). For each `i`, compute the `i`-th odd number as `j = 2*i - 1`.
4. Raise `j` to the fourth power and add it to `sm`.
5. After the loop, return the accumulated sum `sm`.

The code is correct and efficient for the given purpose. However, we can make it more concise by eliminating the temporary variable `j`:

```python
def odd_Num_Sum(n):
    sm = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        odd_num = 2 * i - 1
        sm += odd_num ** 4
    return sm
```

Alternatively, we can use a more Pythonic approach with a generator expression:

```python
def odd_Num_Sum(n):
    return sum((2*i - 1)**4 for i in range(1, n + 1))
```

This version is more concise and readable while maintaining the same functionality.
