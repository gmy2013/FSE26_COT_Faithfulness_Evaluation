CodeGeneration:
the two diagonals of the rhombus.
4. The function calculates the area using the formula and returns it.
5. The implementation is correct and matches the mathematical formula.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def rombus_area(p, q):
    """
    Calculate the area of a rhombus given its diagonals.
    
    Parameters:
    p (float): Length of the first diagonal.
    q (float): Length of the second diagonal.
    
    Returns:
    float: Area of the rhombus calculated as (p * q) / 2.
    
    Examples:
    >>> rombus_area(8, 6)
    24.0
    >>> rombus_area(10.5, 7.2)
    37.8
    """
    area = (p * q) / 2
    return area
```
