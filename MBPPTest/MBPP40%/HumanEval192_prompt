The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function finds the last occurrence of element `x` in a sorted array `arr` of size `n` using binary search

2. **Initialization**:
   - Set `low` to 0 (start index)
   - Set `high` to `n-1` (end index)
   - Initialize `res` to -1 (default return value if element not found)

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Continue while `low <= high` (search space exis
