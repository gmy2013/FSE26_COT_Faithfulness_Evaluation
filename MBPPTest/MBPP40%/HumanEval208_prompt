def check_smaller(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = all(x > y for x, y in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `check_smaller` takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input.
2. The goal is to check if every element in `test_tup1` is greater than the correspon
