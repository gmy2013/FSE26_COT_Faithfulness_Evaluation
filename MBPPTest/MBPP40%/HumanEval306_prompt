The following is chain of thought:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `lucky_num(n)` aims to generate the first `n` lucky numbers.
2. **Initial List Construction**: 
   - Create a list `List` starting from -1, stepping by 2, up to `n*n+9`. This generates odd numbers (with -1 as an anomaly) to form the initial candidate set.
3. **Sieve Process**:
   - Start with index `i=2` (pointing to the third element, which is the first lucky number after 1).
   - In each iteration:
     - Remove every `List[i]`-th element from the current list (simulating the lucky number sieve).
     - Update `List` to be the sorted set difference between th
