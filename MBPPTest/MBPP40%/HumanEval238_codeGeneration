CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected implementation of the function:

```python
def sort_tuple(tup):
    """
    Sorts a tuple of tuples based on the first element of each inner tuple.
    
    Args:
        tup (tuple): A tuple containing tuples to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of tuples (since tuples are immutable)
    """
    # Convert tuple to list for mutability
    lst = list(tup)
    n = len(lst)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if lst[j][0] > lst[j + 1][0]:
                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]
    
    return lst
```

**Key changes made:**
1. Converted the input tuple to a list first since tuples are immutable and cannot be modified in-place
2. Updated the docstring to clarify the function's behavior
3. Changed the return type to list since we can't modify the original tuple
4. Used the list variable throughout the sorting process instead of trying to modify the tuple

**Alternative approach using built-in sorted():**
```python
def sort_tuple(tup):
    """
    Sorts a tuple of tuples based on the first element of each inner tuple.
    
    Args:
        tup (tuple): A tuple containing tuples to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of tuples
    """
    return sorted(tup, key=lambda x: x[0])
```

The second approach is more Pythonic and efficient, using Python's built-in `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key.
