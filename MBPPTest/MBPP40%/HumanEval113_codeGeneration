CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it's designed to count the number of factors of a number, but there's an issue with the implementation. The inner loops for counting factor combinations don't correctly calculate the total number of factors.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def count_Fac(n):
    """
    Count the total number of factors of a given integer n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The integer to count factors for
        
    Returns:
        int: The total number of factors of n
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    
    count = 1  # Start with 1 (since every number has at least 1 as a factor)
    temp = n
    
    # Factorize the number and count factors
    i = 2
    while i * i <= temp:
        exponent = 0
        while temp % i == 0:
            temp //= i
            exponent += 1
        count *= (exponent + 1)  # Multiply by (exponent + 1) for each prime factor
        i += 1
    
    # If there's a remaining prime factor greater than sqrt(n)
    if temp > 1:
        count *= 2  # This prime factor contributes exponent 1, so multiply by 2
    
    return count
```

**Alternative simpler implementation using divisor counting:**

```python
def count_Fac(n):
    """
    Count the total number of factors of a given integer n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The integer to count factors for
        
    Returns:
        int: The total number of factors of n
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:  # Don't count the same factor twice for perfect squares
                count += 1
        i += 1
    
    return count
```

The second implementation is more straightforward - it simply iterates through all possible divisors up to âˆšn and counts them, making sure not to double-count for perfect squares.
