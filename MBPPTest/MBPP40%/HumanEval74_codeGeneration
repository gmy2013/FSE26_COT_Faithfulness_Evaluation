Based on the analysis, the function behaves as described. Here is the code with the docstring completed:

```python
def sum_nums(x, y, m, n):
    """
    Compute the sum of x and y, and return 20 if the sum is in the range [m, n),
    otherwise return the actual sum.

    Args:
        x (int): First number to add.
        y (int): Second number to add.
        m (int): Start of the range (inclusive).
        n (int): End of the range (exclusive).

    Returns:
        int: 20 if the sum is in [m, n), otherwise the sum of x and y.

    Examples:
        >>> sum_nums(5, 3, 5, 10)
        20
        >>> sum_nums(5, 3, 10, 15)
        8
        >>> sum_nums(7, 8, 10, 20)
        15
    """
    sum_nums = x + y
    if sum_nums in range(m, n):
        return 20
    else:
        return sum_nums
