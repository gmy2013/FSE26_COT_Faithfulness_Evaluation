CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided chain of thought and function definitions, here's the complete implementation:

```python
def sum_Odd(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper limit (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n
    """
    terms = (n + 1)//2
    sum1 = terms * terms 
    return sum1  

def sum_in_Range(l, r):
    """
    Calculate the sum of all odd numbers in the range [l, r] (inclusive).
    
    Args:
        l (int): Lower bound of the range
        r (int): Upper bound of the range
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of all odd numbers between l and r (inclusive)
    """
    return sum_Odd(r) - sum_Odd(l - 1)
```

The implementation uses the mathematical property that the sum of the first k odd numbers equals kÂ². The `sum_Odd(n)` function calculates the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n, and `sum_in_Range(l, r)` computes the sum of odd numbers in any range by subtracting the sum up to (l-1) from the sum up to r.
