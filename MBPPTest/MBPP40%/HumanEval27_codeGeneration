1000), and if so, return -1.
5. Convert the string to a list to allow in-place modifications.
6. Extend the list with placeholders to accommodate the new length.
7. Iterate backwards through the original part of the string, replacing spaces with '%20' and shifting other characters.
8. Finally, join the list back into a string and return it.

However, there is a bug in the code: the initial loop to extend the list with placeholders uses an incorrect range. It should extend the list to the new length, but the current loop does not account for the correct starting point and may not add enough placeholders. Also, the backward iteration starts from `i-1` down to 0, but it should include index 0.

Let me correct the code accordingly.

```python
MAX = 1000

def replace_spaces(string):
    string = string.strip()
    i = len(string)
    space_count = string.count(' ')
    new_length = i + space_count * 2
    if new_length > MAX:
        return -1
    index = new_length - 1
    string = list(string)
    # Extend the list to the new length by adding placeholders (e.g., nulls or any char, but we will overwrite)
    # Actually, we need to extend the list to have new_length elements. Currently it has i elements.
    for _ in range(new_length - i):
        string.append(' ')  # Append a placeholder, which will be overwritten
    # Iterate backwards from the end of the original string to the beginning
    for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
        if string[j] == ' ':
            string[index] = '0'
            string[index-1] = '2'
            string[index-2] = '%'
            index -= 3
        else:
            string[index] = string[j]
            index -= 1
    return ''.join(string)
```

But note: the placeholder we append can be any character since we will overwrite them. However, to avoid any confusion, we can use a space or a null character. However, in the backward iteration, we are only reading from indices 0 to i-1, and writing to indices from new_length-1 downwards. So the placeholders beyond index i-1 are safe to be overwritten.

Alternatively, we can avoid appending placeholders by creating a list of the new length initially. Here is a more efficient version:

```python
MAX = 1000

def replace_spaces(string):
    string = string.strip()
    i = len(string)
    space_count = string.count(' ')
    new_length = i + space_count * 2
    if new_length > MAX:
        return -1
    # Create a list with new_length elements, initially filled with placeholders (e.g., spaces)
    res_list = [' '] * new_length
    index = new_length - 1
    # Iterate backwards over the original string
    for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
        if string[j] == ' ':
            res_list[index] = '0'
            res_list[index-1] = '2'
            res_list[index-2] = '%'
            index -= 3
        else:
            res_list[index] = string[j]
            index -= 1
    return ''.join(res_list)
```

This version is cleaner and avoids modifying the original list in-place with appends. It directly creates a list of the required size.

Therefore, the corrected function is:

```python
MAX = 1000

def replace_spaces(string):
    string = string.strip()
    i = len(string)
    space_count = string.count(' ')
    new_length = i + space_count * 2
    if new_length > MAX:
        return -1
    res_list = [' '] * new_length
    index = new_length - 1
    for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
        if string[j] == ' ':
            res_list[index] = '0'
            res_list[index-1] = '2'
            res_list[index-2] = '%'
            index -= 3
        else:
            res_list[index] = string[j]
            index -= 1
    return ''.join(res_list)
```
