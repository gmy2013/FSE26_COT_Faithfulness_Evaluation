CodeGeneration:
ough each element `ele` in the tuple `test_tup`.
4. For each element, increment the count in `res` for that element.
5. Convert the `defaultdict` to a regular dictionary and then to a string to return the frequency dictionary as a string.

Here is the complete function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def freq_element(test_tup):
    res = defaultdict(int)
    for ele in test_tup:
        res[ele] += 1
    return str(dict(res))
```
