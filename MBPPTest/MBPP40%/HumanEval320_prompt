def chunk_tuples(test_tup, N):
  res = [test_tup[i : i + N] for i in range(0, len(test_tup), N)]
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `chunk_tuples` takes two arguments: `test_tup` (a tuple) and `N` (an integer).
2. The goal is to split the tuple into chunks of size `N`.
3. Use list comprehension
