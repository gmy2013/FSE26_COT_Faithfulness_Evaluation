CodeGeneration:
i` from 0 to `n-1`, check if `dp[i]` is reachable (i.e., not `-1`).
   - For each reachable state `i`, consider adding segments of length `a`, `b`, or `c`:
     - If `i + a <= n`, update `dp[i + a]` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[i] + 1`.
     - Similarly for `b` and `c`.

4. **Return Result**: After processing, `dp[n]` holds the maximum segments to form length `n`, or `-1` if not possible.

Here is the complete function with detailed comments:

```python
def maximum_segments(n, a, b, c):
    """
    Compute the maximum number of segments of lengths a, b, or c that can be combined to exactly form a rod of length n.

    Args:
        n (int): Total length of the rod.
        a (int): Length of the first type of segment.
        b (int): Length of the second type of segment.
        c (int): Length of the third type of segment.

    Returns:
        int: Maximum number of segments to form exactly length n, or -1 if not possible.
