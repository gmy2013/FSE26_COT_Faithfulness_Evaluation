CodeGeneration:
4. For each tuple of corresponding elements (m from l1, n from l2, o from l3):
   - Check if all three elements are equal (m == n == o)
   - If they are equal, append the element to the result list
5. Return the result list containing all common elements at corresponding positions

Here is the complete function:

```python
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    """
    Extract elements that are common at the same index positions in all three lists.
    
    Args:
        l1 (list): First input list
        l2 (list): Second input list  
        l3 (list): Third input list
        
    Returns:
        list: List of elements that are equal at the same index positions in all three lists
        
    Example:
        >>> extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        [1, 3, 4, 5]
    """
    result = []
    for m, n, o in zip(l1, l2, l3):
        if (m == n == o):
            result.append(m)
    return result
```
