The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `previous_palindrome` takes an integer `num` as input.
2. It needs to find the largest palindrome number that is strictly less than `num`.
3. The current implementation uses a for loop that starts from `num-1` and decrements down to 1.
4. For each number `x` in this range, it converts
