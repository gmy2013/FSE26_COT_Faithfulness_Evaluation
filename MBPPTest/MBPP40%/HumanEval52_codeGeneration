CodeGeneration:
e over each key-value pair in the input list `l`.
4. For each pair, append the value `v` to the list associated with key `k` in the dictionary.
5. Return the resulting dictionary with keys mapped to lists of their corresponding values.

Here is the complete function:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def grouping_dictionary(l):
    """
    Groups key-value pairs from a list into a dictionary where each key maps to a list of values.
    
    Args:
        l (list): A list of tuples where each tuple is (key, value)
    
    Returns:
        defaultdict: A dictionary with keys mapping to lists of values
    """
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for k, v in l:
        d[k].append(v)
    return d
```
