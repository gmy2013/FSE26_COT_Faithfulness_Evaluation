CodeGeneration:
g the elements of `test_tup`.
3. The function then returns the modified list `test_list`.

However, note that the function modifies the original list passed in as an argument (since lists are mutable in Python), and returns a reference to that same modified list.

Here's the complete function with proper documentation:

```python
def add_tuple(test_list, test_tup):
    """
    Add all elements from a tuple to the end of a list.
    
    This function modifies the original list in-place by extending it
    with all elements from the given tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): The list to be extended
        test_tup (tuple): The tuple whose elements will be added to the list
    
    Returns:
        list: The modified list (same object as test_list)
    
    Example:
        >>> my_list = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> my_tuple = (4, 5)
        >>> add_tuple(my_list, my_tuple)
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> my_list
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    """
    test_list += test_tup
    return test_list
```
