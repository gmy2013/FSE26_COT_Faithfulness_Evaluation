def is_odd(n) : 
    if (n^1 == n-1) :
        return True; 
    else :
        return False; 
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze this function step by step:

1. The function is supposed to determine if a number is odd
2. The current implementation uses bitwise XOR (^) operation
3. Let's test the logic with actual numbers:
   - For odd number (n=3): 3^1 = 2, 3-1 = 2 → 2==2 → True ✓
   - For even number (n=4): 4^1 = 5, 4-1 = 3 → 5==3 → False ✓
