CodeGeneration:
rator that produces (key, group) pairs where each group is an iterator of consecutive identical elements.
4. We convert each group to a list and return a list of these groups.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from itertools import groupby

def pack_consecutive_duplicates(list1):
    """
    Packs consecutive duplicate elements in a list into sublists.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): Input list containing elements that may have consecutive duplicates.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of sublists where each sublist contains consecutive duplicate elements.
    
    Examples:
        >>> pack_consecutive_duplicates([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5])
        [[1, 1], [2], [3, 3, 3], [4], [5, 5]]
        
        >>> pack_consecutive_duplicates(['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'a'])
        [['a', 'a'], ['b'], ['c', 'c'], ['a']]
    """
    return [list(group) for key, group in groupby(list1)]
```
