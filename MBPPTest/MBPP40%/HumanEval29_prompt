  else: 
     yield from [idx for j in range(ele[0] - 1, ele[0] + 2)

The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze this code step by step:

1. **Function `adjac(ele, sub=[])`**:
   - This is a recursive generator function
   - Base case: if `ele` is empty, it yields the current `sub` list
   - Recursive case: for each element in `ele`, it generates values in the range `[ele[0]-1, ele[0]+1]` (inclusive)
   - It recursively calls itself with the remaining elements and appends each generated value to `sub`

2. **Function `get_coordinates(test_tup)`**:
   - Calls `adjac(test_tup)` to g
