CodeGeneration:
n.
   - `n / i == i`: This checks if the other divisor is also `i`, meaning `n = i*i`.
4. If both conditions are true, it returns `True` (indicating `n` is a perfect square).
5. If the loop completes without finding such `i`, it returns `False`.

However, note that the condition `(n % i == 0) and (n / i == i)` is equivalent to `i * i == n`, but with an extra divisibility check. Since `i*i == n` implies `n % i == 0`, the divisibility check is redundant.

We can simplify the function by directly checking if `i*i == n`. Here's the improved version:

```python
def is_Perfect_Square(n):
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if i * i == n:
            return True
        i += 1
    return False
```

This version is more efficient and clearer. It iterates through integers `i` starting from 1, and for each, checks if `i*i` equals `n`. If found, returns `True`; if the square exceeds `n`, returns `False`.

Let me write the complete function accordingly.
