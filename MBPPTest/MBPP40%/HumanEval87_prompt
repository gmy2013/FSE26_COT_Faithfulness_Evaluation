def len_complex(a,b):

  length=abs(cn)
  return length
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `len_complex` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
2. A complex number `cn` is created using `complex(a, b)`.
3. The absolute value
