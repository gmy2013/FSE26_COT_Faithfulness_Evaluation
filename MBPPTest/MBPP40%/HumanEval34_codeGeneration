s the min-heap property.
4. After building the heap, pop elements one by one using `heapq.heappop` to get them in sorted order (ascending).
5. Return the list of popped elements, which is the sorted version of the input.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
import heapq as hq

def heap_sort(iterable):
    """
    Sorts the given iterable in ascending order using a heap.

    Parameters:
    iterable (iterable): An iterable of elements to be sorted.

    Returns:
    list: A sorted list of elements from the input iterable.

    Example:
    >>> heap_sort([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0])
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    """
    h = []
    for value in iterable:
        hq.heappush(h, value)
    return [hq.heappop(h) for i in range(len(h))]
```
