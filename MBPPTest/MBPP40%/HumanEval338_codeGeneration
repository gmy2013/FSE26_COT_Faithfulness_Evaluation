CodeGeneration:
ist of models alphabetically by their 'color' attribute.
4. We use the built-in `sorted` function with a lambda function as the key to extract the 'color' value for each model.
5. The sorted list is then returned.

Here is the completed function:

```python
def sorted_models(models):
    """Sort a list of model dictionaries alphabetically by their color.
    
    Args:
        models: A list of dictionaries, each representing a model with a 'color' key.
        
    Returns:
        A new list of the same model dictionaries, sorted by color in ascending order.
    """
    sorted_models = sorted(models, key=lambda x: x['color'])
    return sorted_models
```
