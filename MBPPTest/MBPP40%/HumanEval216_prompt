def div_of_nums(nums,m,n):
 result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 or x % n == 0), nums)) 
 return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `div_of_nums` takes three parameters: `nums` (a list of numbers), `m`, and `n` (divisors).
2. The goal is to return a new list containing elements from `nums` that are divisible by `m` OR div
