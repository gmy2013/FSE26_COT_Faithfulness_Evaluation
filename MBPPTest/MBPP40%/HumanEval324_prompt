def mutiple_tuple(nums):
    temp = list(nums)
    product = 1 
    for x in temp:
        product *= x
    return product
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `mutiple_tuple` takes a tuple `nums` as input.
2. Convert the tuple to a list and store it in `temp`.
3. Initialize `product` to 1 to accumulate the multiplica
