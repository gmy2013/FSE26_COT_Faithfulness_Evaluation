CodeGeneration:
to a very large number (like 10**20) to ensure any valid difference will be smaller.
5. Iterate through the sorted array from the first element to the second last element.
6. For each element at index `i`, calculate the difference with the next element (at index `i+1`).
7. If this difference is smaller than the current `diff`, update `diff` to this new smaller value.
8. After processing all adjacent pairs, return the smallest difference found.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def find_Min_Diff(arr, n):
    """
    Find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): List of integers
    n (int): Length of the array
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum difference between any two elements
    """
    arr = sorted(arr)
    diff = 10**20
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i+1] - arr[i] < diff:
            diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]
    return diff
```
