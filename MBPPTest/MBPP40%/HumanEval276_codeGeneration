CodeGeneration:
combine the sorted list of characters back into a string.
3. Consider edge cases: 
   - Empty string: `sorted('')` returns an empty list, and `''.join([])` returns an empty string, which is correct.
   - String with duplicate characters: The function handles duplicates correctly by including them in sorted order.
   - String with mixed case: Uppercase letters come before lowercase in ASCII, so 'B' would come before 'a'.
4. Verify the return statement: The function returns the sorted string wrapped in parentheses, which creates a tuple. However, based on the docstring, we should return a string, not a tuple.

Correction needed: Remove the parentheses around `str` in the return statement to return the string directly instead of a tuple.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def sort_String(s): 
    s = ''.join(sorted(s)) 
    return s
```

Note: I also changed the parameter name from `str` to `s` to avoid shadowing the built-in `str` type.
