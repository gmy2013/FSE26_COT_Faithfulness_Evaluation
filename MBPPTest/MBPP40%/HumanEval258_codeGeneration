CodeGeneration:
`my_list` (inclusive), generating combinations of each size.
4. For each size `i`, `combinations(my_list, i)` returns tuples of all combinations of `i` elements from `my_list`.
5. These tuples are converted to lists using a list comprehension.
6. If the generated list for a particular `i` is non-empty (which it always is except when `i=0` and `my_list` is empty, but `combinations` handles this correctly), the sublists are added to the result list `subs`.
7. Finally, the complete list of all sublists is returned.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def sub_lists(my_list):
    """
    Generate all possible sublists (subsets) of the input list.
    
    Args:
        my_list (list): Input list to generate sublists from
        
    Returns:
        list: List of all possible sublists (including empty list)
        
    Examples:
        >>> sub_lists([1, 2, 3])
        [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
        
        >>> sub_lists(['a'])
        [[], ['a']]
    """
    subs = []
    for i in range(0, len(my_list)+1):
        temp = [list(x) for x in combinations(my_list, i)]
        if len(temp)>0:
            subs.extend(temp)
    return subs
```

The function efficiently generates all 2^n possible sublists of the input list using itertools.combinations for optimal performance.
