import math 
def is_polite(n): 
	n = n + 1
	return (int)(n+(math.log((n + math.log(n, 2)), 2))) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `is_polite(n)` aims to compute the nth polite number.
2. Polite numbers are positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
3. The formula used here is based on the known mathematical relationship: the nth polite number is approximately n + log₂(n + log₂(n)).
4. Step-by-step breakdown:
   - First, increment n by 1 (this adjusts the ind
