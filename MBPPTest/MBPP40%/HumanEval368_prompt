The following is chain of thought:
1. Initialize an empty list `res` to store the merged tuples as lists (for mutability during processing).
2. Iterate through each tuple `sub` in the input list `test_list`.
3. Check if `res` is not empty and the first element of the last list in `res` matches the first
