The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the min_sum_path function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function finds the minimum sum path from top to bottom in a triangular matrix (like a pyramid) using dynamic programming with bottom-up approach

2. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a memoization array of the same length as the input list A
   - Store the last row values directly into memo since they represen
