def parallelogram_perimeter(b, h):
    """
    Calculate the perimeter of a parallelogram.

    The perimeter of a parallelogram is calculated as 2*(base + side),
    where the side length can be derived from the height using the
    Pythagorean theorem if needed. However, this function assumes
    the parallelogram is a rectangle for simplicity, where height
    equals the side length perpendicular to the base.

    Args:
        b (float): Length of the base of the parallelogram.
        h (float): Height of the parallelogram (perpendicular to base).

    Returns:
        float: Perimeter of the parallelogram.

    Note:
        This implementation treats the parallelogram as a rectangle
        where the height equals the adjacent side length. For a general
        parallelogram with different side lengths, additional parameters
        would be needed.
    """
    # For a rectangle (special case of parallelogram), perimeter = 2*(b + h)
    # where h is the height and also the length of the adjacent side
    perimeter = 2 * (b + h)
    return perimeter
