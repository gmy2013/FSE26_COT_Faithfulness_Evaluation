CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function with improved code style and documentation:

```python
import itertools


def remove_duplicates(input_list):
    """
    Remove duplicates from a list while preserving order of first occurrence.
    
    Args:
        input_list: List containing elements (may have duplicates)
    
    Returns:
        List with duplicates removed, sorted in ascending order
    """
    # Sort the list first to group duplicates together
    input_list.sort()
    
    # Use itertools.groupby to group consecutive identical elements
    # and extract only the first occurrence of each unique element
    result = [key for key, _ in itertools.groupby(input_list)]
    
    return result
```

Key improvements made:
1. Renamed `list1` to `input_list` for better clarity
2. Fixed the function name to be more descriptive (`remove_duplicates`)
3. Added proper docstring with parameter and return value descriptions
4. Used list comprehension instead of the more complex `list(list1 for list1,_ in itertools.groupby(list1))`
5. Added proper indentation and spacing for readability

The function works by:
1. Sorting the input list to group duplicate values together
2. Using `itertools.groupby()` to identify consecutive duplicate groups
3. Extracting only the first element from each group (the unique values)
4. Returning the list of unique values in sorted order
