CodeGeneration:
5. If it is a tuple, break out of the loop immediately.
6. Otherwise, increment the counter by 1.
7. After the loop (either by breaking or finishing the iteration), return the counter value.

The function counts the number of elements from the start of the iterable until the first tuple is encountered (excluding the tuple itself).

Here is the complete function:

```python
def count_elim(num):
  count_elim = 0
  for n in num:
    if isinstance(n, tuple):
        break
    count_elim += 1
  return count_elim
```
