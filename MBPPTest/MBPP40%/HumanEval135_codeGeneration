CodeGeneration:
ertion point is the index at which `x` would be inserted to keep the list sorted, with any existing entries of `x` placed to the right.
4. The function returns this index.

Here is the complete function:

```python
import bisect

def left_insertion(a, x):
    """Return the index where to insert item x in list a, assuming a is sorted.

    The return value i is such that all e in a[:i] have e < x, and all e in
    a[i:] have e >= x.  So if x already appears in the list, a.insert(i, x) will
    insert just before the leftmost x already there.

    Args:
        a (list): A sorted list.
        x: The value to insert.

    Returns:
        int: The insertion index.
    """
    i = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
    return i
```
