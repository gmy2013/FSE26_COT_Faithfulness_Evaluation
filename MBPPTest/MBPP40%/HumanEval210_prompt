  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function needs to check if two lists are identical
2. **Input Parameters**: Accepts two lists (test_list1 and test_list2) as input
3. **Core Logic**: Uses the equality operator (==) to compare both lists
   - The == operator compares list elements in order and
