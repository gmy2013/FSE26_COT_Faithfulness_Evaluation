The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the count_Unset_Bits function:

1. **Function Purpose**: Count the total number of unset bits (0s) in the binary representations of all numbers from 1 to n

2. **Initialization**: 
   - Initialize a counter variable `cnt` to 0 to accumulate the total unset bits

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
   - For each number
