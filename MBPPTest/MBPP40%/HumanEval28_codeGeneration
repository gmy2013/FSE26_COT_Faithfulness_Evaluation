CodeGeneration:
likely intends to split the list into even and odd numbers, returning both lists.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def Split(list):
    """Split a list into even and odd numbers.
    
    Args:
        list: Input list of integers
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists - (even_numbers, odd_numbers)
    """
    ev_li = []
    od_li = []
    for i in list:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            ev_li.append(i)
        else:
            od_li.append(i)
    return (ev_li, od_li)
```

The function now:
1. Creates two separate lists for even and odd numbers
2. Iterates through the input list and categorizes each number
3. Returns both lists as a tuple for easy unpacking
4. Includes a proper docstring explaining the function's purpose and return value
