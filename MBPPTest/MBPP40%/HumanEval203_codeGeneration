CodeGeneration:
e large and inefficient), we can simply check if any element in the array is even.
4. If we find at least one even number, we return True immediately.
5. If no even number is found after checking all elements, we return False.

Here is the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def is_Product_Even(arr, n):
    """
    Check if the product of all elements in the array is even.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): The input array of integers.
    n (int): The number of elements in the array.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the product is even, False otherwise.

    Explanation:
    The product of numbers is even if at least one number is even.
    This function checks for the presence of any even number in the array.
    """
    for i in range(0, n):
        if ((arr[i] & 1) == 0):
            return True
    return False
```
