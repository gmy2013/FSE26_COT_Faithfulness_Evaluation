CodeGeneration:
`number` using the formula: (n(n+1)/2)^2, which is the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers, equivalent to the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers.

Here is the corrected and completed function:

```python
import math

def sum_series(number):
    """
    Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers.
    
    Args:
        number (int): The number of terms to sum (n)
    
    Returns:
        float: The sum of cubes from 1^3 to n^3
    """
    total = 0
    total = math.pow((number * (number + 1)) / 2, 2)
    return total
```

The function correctly implements the mathematical identity that the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers equals the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers: ∑k³ = (∑k)² = [n(n+1)/2]²
