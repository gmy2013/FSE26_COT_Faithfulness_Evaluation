CodeGeneration:
next element. If they are different (i.e., unique), add the next element to the sum.
   - Return the accumulated sum

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function assumes the array has at least one element (n >= 1)
   - It doesn't handle empty arrays (n = 0)
   - The sorting step is O(n log n) complexity
   - The approach works but could be optimized for better readability

5. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Using a set to remove duplicates first, then summing
   - Using dictionary keys to get unique elements
   - Using list comprehension with conditional checks

Here's the improved implementation:

```python
def find_Sum(arr, n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of unique elements in an array.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): List of numbers
        n (int): Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        int/float: Sum of unique elements in the array
    
    Example:
        >>> find_Sum([1, 2, 3, 2, 1], 5)
        6
        >>> find_Sum([1, 1, 1, 1], 4)
        1
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # More efficient approach using set
    return sum(set(arr))
```

The improved version:
- Handles empty arrays
- Uses set to automatically remove duplicates
- Is more concise and readable
- Has the same time complexity (O(n)) for the set operation
- Maintains the same functionality with cleaner code
