, it accesses the last element using `item[-1]`.
4. It returns a new list containing these last elements from each sublist.

This function assumes that each `item` in `lst` is a list or sequence with at least one element. If any sublist is empty, it will raise an `IndexError`.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def Extract(lst):
    """Extract the last element from each sublist in the given list.
    
    Args:
        lst: A list of lists (or other indexable sequences)
        
    Returns:
        A list containing the last element from each sublist
        
    Raises:
        IndexError: If any sublist is empty
    """
    return [item[-1] for item in lst]
```
