CodeGeneration:
I notice the function is already implemented, but there are a few issues that should be addressed for correctness and consistency:

1. The 'sheep' sign should be capitalized for consistency with other signs
2. The docstring mentioned in your prompt is missing
3. The chain of thought suggests this is based on year 2000 as a Dragon year reference

Here's the improved version with proper docstring:

```python
def chinese_zodiac(year):
    """
    Calculate the Chinese zodiac sign for a given year.
    
    The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is represented by an animal.
    This function uses the year 2000 (Dragon year) as the reference point.
    
    Args:
        year (int): The year to find the zodiac sign for
        
    Returns:
        str: The Chinese zodiac animal sign
    """
    if (year - 2000) % 12 == 0:
        sign = 'Dragon'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 1:
        sign = 'Snake'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 2:
        sign = 'Horse'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 3:
        sign = 'Sheep'  # Fixed capitalization
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 4:
        sign = 'Monkey'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 5:
        sign = 'Rooster'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 6:
        sign = 'Dog'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 7:
        sign = 'Pig'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 8:
        sign = 'Rat'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 9:
        sign = 'Ox'
    elif (year - 2000) % 12 == 10:
        sign = 'Tiger'
    else:
        sign = 'Hare'
    return sign
```

This function will correctly return the Chinese zodiac sign for any given year using 2000 as the Dragon year reference point.
