CodeGeneration:
he first element is the maximum of the first elements of `x` and `y`, and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of these computed tuples.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def max_similar_indices(test_list1, test_list2):
    """
    Takes two lists of tuples and returns a list of tuples where each tuple
    contains the maximum of corresponding elements from the input tuples.
    
    Args:
        test_list1 (list): First list of tuples
        test_list2 (list): Second list of tuples
        
    Returns:
        list: List of tuples with maximum values from corresponding positions
    
    Example:
        >>> max_similar_indices([(1, 2), (3, 4)], [(2, 1), (1, 5)])
        [(2, 2), (3, 5)]
    """
    res = [(max(x[0], y[0]), max(x[1], y[1]))
           for x, y in zip(test_list1, test_list2)]
    return res
```

The function works by:
1. Using `zip()` to pair corresponding tuples from both lists
2. For each pair `(x, y)`, creating a new tuple where:
   - First element is `max(x[0], y[0])` (maximum of first elements)
   - Second element is `max(x[1], y[1])` (maximum of second elements)
3. Returning the list of these computed tuples
