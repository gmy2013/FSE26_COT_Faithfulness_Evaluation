def tuple_modulo(test_tup1, test_tup2):

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `tuple_modulo` takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input.
2. It needs to compute the modulo operation element-wise between corresponding elements of the two tuples.
3. The function uses `zip()` to pair elements from both tuples toget
