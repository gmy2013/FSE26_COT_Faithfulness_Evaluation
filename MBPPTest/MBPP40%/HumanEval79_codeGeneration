CodeGeneration:
he sorted list with the original list.
3. However, this approach creates a new sorted list which has O(n log n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity.
4. A more efficient approach would be to iterate through the list once and check if each element is <= the next element.
5. This would have O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Here's the improved implementation:

```python
def increasing_trend(nums):
    """
    Check if the given list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of numbers to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, False otherwise
    """
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

This implementation:
- Handles empty lists and single-element lists correctly (returns True)
- Only requires O(n) time complexity (one pass through the list)
- Uses O(1) space complexity (no additional data structures)
- Stops early if it finds any element that violates the non-decreasing order
