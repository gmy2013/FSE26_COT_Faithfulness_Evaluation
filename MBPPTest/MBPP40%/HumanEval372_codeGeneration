CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function:

```python
def left_rotate(s, d):
    """
    Rotates a string left by d positions.
    
    Args:
        s (str): The input string to be rotated
        d (int): Number of positions to rotate left
    
    Returns:
        str: The rotated string
    
    Example:
        >>> left_rotate("abcdef", 2)
        'cdefab'
        >>> left_rotate("hello", 3)
        'lohel'
    """
    tmp = s[d : ] + s[0 : d]
    return tmp
```

The function works by:
1. Taking the substring from position `d` to the end of the string
2. Concatenating it with the substring from the beginning to position `d`
3. Returning the combined result

This effectively rotates the string left by `d` positions, moving the first `d` characters to the end of the string.
