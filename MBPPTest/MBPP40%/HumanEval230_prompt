def count_Pairs(arr,n): 
    cnt = 0; 
    for i in range(n): 
        for j in range(i + 1,n): 
            if (arr[i] == arr[j]): 
                cnt += 1; 
    return cnt; 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_Pairs` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input.
2. Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0 to keep track of the number of pairs.
3. Use a nested loop structure:
   - Outer loop iterates over each element with index `i` from 0 to n-1.
