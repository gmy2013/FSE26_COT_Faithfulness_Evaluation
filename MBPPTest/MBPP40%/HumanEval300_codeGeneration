CodeGeneration:
ization**: Start from i = n*2 (since n is the largest factor, the LCM must be at least n, but likely larger).
5. **Factor list**: Create a list of factors from n down to floor(n/2)+1 (i.e., numbers > n/2).
6. **Increment strategy**: If i is not divisible by any factor, increment by n (since LCM must be multiple of n) and restart check.
7. **Termination**: If i is divisible by all factors in the list, return i.

Here is the corrected and optimized code:

```python
def smallest_multiple(n):
    """
    Returns the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Upper bound of the range (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: The smallest multiple divisible by all numbers 1 through n
    
    Examples:
        >>> smallest_multiple(5)
        60
        >>> smallest_multiple(10)
        2520
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Only need to check factors greater than n/2
    factors = [number for number in range(n, n//2, -1)]
    
    i = n
    while True:
        i += n  # LCM must be multiple of largest number
        divisible = True
        for factor in factors:
            if i % factor != 0:
                divisible = False
                break
        if divisible:
            return i
```

This implementation:
- Starts checking from i = 2n (first increment adds n to initial n)
- Uses a more efficient factor list (numbers > n/2)
- Has cleaner loop structure with boolean flag
- Maintains the optimization of incrementing by n
- Handles edge cases properly
- Has proper docstring with examples
