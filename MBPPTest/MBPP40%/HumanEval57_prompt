def max_occurrences(list1):
    max_val = 0
    result = list1[0] 
    for i in list1:
        occu = list1.count(i)
        if occu > max_val:
            max_val = occu
            result = i 
    return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. Initialize `max_val` to 0 to track the maximum occurrence count found so far.
2. Initialize `result` to the first element of `list1` as a starting candidate.
3. Iterate through each element `i` in `list1`:
   - Calculate the occurrence count of `i` in `li
