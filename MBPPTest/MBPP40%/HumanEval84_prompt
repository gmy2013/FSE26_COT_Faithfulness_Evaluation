The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sum_Of_Primes(n)` computes the sum of all prime numbers up to and including `n`.
2. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers in a boolean list `prime` of length `n+1`.
3. Initialize `prime` with all `True` values, assuming all numbers are prime in
