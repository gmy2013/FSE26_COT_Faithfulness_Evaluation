CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the corrected variable name in the count() call:

```python
def max_occurrences(list1):
    max_val = 0
    result = list1[0] 
    for i in list1:
        occu = list1.count(i)
        if occu > max_val:
            max_val = occu
            result = i 
    return result
```

The function works correctly to find the element that occurs most frequently in the list. If multiple elements have the same maximum frequency, it will return the first one encountered with that frequency.
