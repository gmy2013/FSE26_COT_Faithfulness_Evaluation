CodeGeneration:
ent `x`, check if it is not already in `temp`.
4. If it is not in `temp`, append it to `temp`.
5. After processing all elements, return `temp` which contains unique elements in the order of their first occurrence.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def remove_duplic_list(l):
    temp = []
    for x in l:
        if x not in temp:
            temp.append(x)
    return temp
```
