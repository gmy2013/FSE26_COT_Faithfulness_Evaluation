CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function based on the docstring and chain of thought:

```python
def fifth_Power_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculates the sum of the fifth powers of all integers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound of the range (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of i^5 for i from 1 to n
    """
    sm = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sm = sm + (i * i * i * i * i)
    return sm
```

The function is already complete and correctly implements the described logic. It:
1. Initializes `sm` to 0 to accumulate the sum
2. Iterates through integers 1 to n (inclusive) using `range(1, n + 1)`
3. Adds the fifth power of each integer to the running total
4. Returns the final sum

The fifth power is calculated as `i * i * i * i * i` which is equivalent to i‚Åµ.
