def rearrange_numbs(array_nums):
  result = sorted(array_nums, key = lambda i: 0 if i == 0 else -1 / i)
  return result 
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Rearrange numbers with zeros at the front and positive numbers in increasing order after negatives.
2. Analyze the current implementation: Uses sorted() with a key that gives 0 for zeros and -1/i for non-zero numbers.
3. Identify the issue: The key doesn't properly handle negative numbers and positive numbers separately.
4. Correct approach nee
