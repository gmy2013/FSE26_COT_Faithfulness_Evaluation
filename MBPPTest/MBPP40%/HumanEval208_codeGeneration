CodeGeneration:
ding element in `test_tup2`.
3. We use `zip()` to pair corresponding elements from both tuples.
4. We use a generator expression with `all()` to check if all pairs satisfy `x > y`.
5. The result is returned as a boolean value.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def check_smaller(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """
    Check if every element in test_tup1 is greater than the corresponding element in test_tup2.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1 (tuple): First tuple of numbers
        test_tup2 (tuple): Second tuple of numbers
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements in test_tup1 > corresponding elements in test_tup2, False otherwise
    
    Example:
        >>> check_smaller((5, 6, 7), (2, 3, 4))
        True
        >>> check_smaller((5, 6, 7), (2, 7, 4))
        False
    """
    res = all(x > y for x, y in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
    return res
```

Note: This function assumes both tuples have the same length. If the tuples have different lengths, `zip()` will only iterate up to the length of the shorter tuple.
