CodeGeneration:
ements in the list.
3. We can use the built-in `sum()` function to get the total sum of the list.
4. We can use the built-in `len()` function to get the number of elements.
5. The average is calculated by dividing the sum by the length.
6. We return this result.

The implementation is already correct and complete:

```python
def Average(lst):
    return sum(lst) / len(lst)
```
