Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def nth_nums(nums, n):
    """
    Raise each number in the given list to the nth power.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): A list of numbers
        n (int): The exponent to raise each number to
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list where each element is the corresponding element from nums raised to the nth power
    
    Examples:
        >>> nth_nums([1, 2, 3], 2)
        [1, 4, 9]
        >>> nth_nums([2, 4, 6], 3)
        [8, 64, 216]
    """
    nth_nums = list(map(lambda x: x ** n, nums))
    return nth_nums
```

The function works by:
1. Using `map()` to apply a lambda function to each element in `nums`
2. The lambda function raises each element `x` to the power of `n` (x ** n)
3. Converting the map object to a list and returning it

This creates a new list where each element from the original list is raised to the specified power.
