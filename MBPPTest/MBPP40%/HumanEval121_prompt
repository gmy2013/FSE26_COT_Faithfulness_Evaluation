def filter_data(students,h,w):
    result = {k: s for k, s in students.items() if s[0] >=h and s[1] >=w}
    return result    
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Filter a dictionary of students based on height and weight thresholds.
2. Identify input parameters:
   - students: dictionary with student data (keys: student names, values: tuples/lists with height and weight)
   - h: minimum height threshold
   - w: minimum weight threshold
3. Analyze the
