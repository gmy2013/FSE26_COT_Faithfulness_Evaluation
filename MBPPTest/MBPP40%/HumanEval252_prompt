The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the sum_of_odd_Factors function:

1. **Initialize result**: Start with res = 1 since 1 is always an odd factor of any number

2. **Remove even factors**: While n is divisible by 2, keep dividing n by 2 to eliminate all even prime factors

3. **Process odd prime factors**: 
   - Iterate through potential odd prime factors from 3 to âˆšn
   - For each prime fact
