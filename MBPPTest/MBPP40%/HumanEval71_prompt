The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_of_three` takes three numbers as input: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
2. It compares `num1` to both `num2` and `num3` using an `if` condition. If `num1` is greater than or equal to both, it assigns `num1` to `lnum`.
3. If the first condition fails, it checks if `
