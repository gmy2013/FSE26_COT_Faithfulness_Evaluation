CodeGeneration:
nsecutive identical elements) is equal to `n`.
4. If so, it includes the element in the result list.
5. Finally, it returns the list of elements that appear exactly `n` times consecutively.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from itertools import groupby

def extract_elements(numbers, n):
    """
    Extract elements that appear exactly n times consecutively in the list.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): List of numbers to process
        n (int): Number of consecutive occurrences to filter by
    
    Returns:
        list: Elements that appear exactly n times consecutively
    
    Example:
        >>> extract_elements([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], 2)
        [1, 3]
        >>> extract_elements([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], 3)
        [1, 3]
    """
    result = [i for i, j in groupby(numbers) if len(list(j)) == n] 
    return result
```
