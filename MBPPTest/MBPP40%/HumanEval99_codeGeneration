CodeGeneration:
each element `x` in the list `li`.
4. Check if `x` is between `min` and `max` (inclusive) using the condition `min <= x <= max`.
5. If the condition is true, increment the counter `ctr` by 1.
6. After processing all elements, return the final count `ctr`.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def count_range_in_list(li, min, max):
    """
    Count the number of elements in the list that fall within the specified range [min, max].
    
    Args:
        li (list): The list of elements to check
        min (int/float): The lower bound of the range (inclusive)
        max (int/float): The upper bound of the range (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: The count of elements in the range [min, max]
    """
    ctr = 0
    for x in li:
        if min <= x <= max:
            ctr += 1
    return ctr
```
