CodeGeneration:
h sublist using list comprehension: `[sub[N] for sub in test_list]`
   - Find the maximum value from those extracted elements using `max()`
   - Return the maximum value

4. **Edge Cases Consideration**:
   - If test_list is empty, the function would raise an IndexError when trying to access sub[N]
   - If N is out of range for any sublist, it would raise an IndexError
   - The function assumes all sublists have at least N+1 elements

5. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Could use a generator expression instead of list comprehension for memory efficiency
   - Could add error handling for edge cases

Here's the complete function with the chain of thought incorporated:

```python
def max_of_nth(test_list, N):
    """
    Find the maximum value in the Nth position across all sublists in test_list.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): List containing sublists (each sublist must have at least N+1 elements)
        N (int): Index specifying which position in each sublist to examine
    
    Returns:
        The maximum value found at the Nth position across all sublists
    
    Raises:
        IndexError: If test_list is empty or if N is out of range for any sublist
    """
    # Extract all Nth elements from each sublist using list comprehension
    # and find the maximum value among them
    res = max([sub[N] for sub in test_list])
    return res
```

The function works by:
1. Using list comprehension to create a new list containing only the Nth element from each sublist
2. Applying the built-in `max()` function to find the largest value in that list
3. Returning the result

Note: This implementation assumes all sublists have at least N+1 elements and that test_list is not empty.
