CodeGeneration:
e current list and the removed elements.
   - Increment `i` to move to the next lucky number for sieving.
4. **Return Result**: After sieving, return the first `n` elements (excluding the initial -1) as the lucky numbers.

However, the original code has issues:
- The initial list includes -1, which is not a positive integer and should not be in the lucky numbers.
- The slicing `List[List[i]::List[i]]` is incorrect because `List[i]` is used as both an index and a step, leading to errors.
- The while condition `List[i:]` may cause index errors if `i` exceeds the list length.

Let's correct the function step by step:

1. **Initial List**: Should start from 1 (the first lucky number) and include odd numbers up to a sufficiently large limit (e.g., `n*n+10` to ensure we have at least `n` lucky numbers).
2. **Sieve Process**:
   - Start with `i=1` (so the second element in the list, which is 3, is the first number to sieve with).
   - In each iteration, if `i` is within the list bounds:
        - The step for removal is `lst[i]` (the current lucky number).
        - Remove elements at positions `lst[i]-1, 2*lst[i]-1, ...` (since list indices start at 0).
   - Update the list by removing these elements.
   - Increment `i` only if we haven't removed the element at `i` (so we check the next number).
3. **Return**: The first `n` elements of the sieved list.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def lucky_num(n):
    # Generate initial list of odd numbers starting from 1 (the first lucky number)
    lst = list(range(1, n*n+10, 2))
    i = 1  # start with the second element (index 1) which is 3
    while i < len(lst):
        step = lst[i]
        # Indices to remove: starting at index step-1, then step-1 + step, etc.
        remove_indices = list(range(step-1, len(lst), step))
        # Remove elements at these indices (from highest to lowest to avoid index shifting)
        for idx in sorted(remove_indices, reverse=True):
            if idx < len(lst):
                del lst[idx]
        i += 1
    return lst[:n]
```

This code correctly implements the lucky number sieve and returns the first `n` lucky numbers.
