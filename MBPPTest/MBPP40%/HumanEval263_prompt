def palindrome_lambda(texts):
  result = list(filter(lambda x: (x == "".join(reversed(x))), texts))
  return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Filter a list of strings to return only palindromes.
2. Analyze the current implementation: Uses filter with lambda to check if string equals its reverse.
3. Identify the issue: The lambda function correctly checks for palindromes but has unnecessary paren
