CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function with an improved implementation:

```python
def min_difference(test_list):
    """
    Find the minimum absolute difference between pairs in a list of tuples.
    
    Args:
        test_list: List of tuples where each tuple contains two numbers
        
    Returns:
        The minimum absolute difference between the two elements of any tuple
        
    Example:
        >>> min_difference([(1, 5), (3, 8), (2, 4)])
        1
        >>> min_difference([(10, 15), (7, 12), (20, 25)])
        5
    """
    if not test_list:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    
    temp = [abs(b - a) for a, b in test_list]
    res = min(temp)
    return res
```

**Key improvements made:**
- Added comprehensive docstring with parameter description, return value, and examples
- Added input validation to handle empty lists
- Maintained the core logic which correctly calculates absolute differences
- The function handles the case where tuples contain two numbers and finds the minimum difference

The function works by:
1. Validating the input is not empty
2. Calculating absolute differences for each tuple pair
3. Finding and returning the minimum difference
