CodeGeneration:
nequality theorem, but the implementation has a logical error in the condition
4. **Error Identification**: The condition `(a + b) >= c or (b + c) >= a or (a + c) >= b` should use AND instead of OR
5. **Correct Implementation**: All three triangle inequalities must be satisfied simultaneously for a valid triangle

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_triangleexists(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if three angles can form a valid triangle.
    
    A valid triangle must satisfy:
    1. All angles are positive (non-zero)
    2. Sum of angles equals 180Â°
    3. Each angle is less than the sum of the other two angles
    
    Args:
        a, b, c (float): Three angles in degrees
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the angles can form a valid triangle, False otherwise
    """
    if a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0 and (a + b + c) == 180:
        # Check all three triangle inequalities
        if (a + b > c) and (b + c > a) and (a + c > b):
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False
```

The key changes made:
- Changed `!= 0` to `> 0` to ensure positive angles
- Changed OR to AND in the triangle inequality check
- Changed `>=` to `>` to properly handle the strict inequality requirement
- Added proper docstring documentation
