The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the count_Char function:

1. **Function Purpose**: Count occurrences of character 'x' in the first 'n' characters of a repeated string
2. **Initial Count**: Count occurrences of 'x' in the original string
3. **Repetition Calculation**: Determine how many full repetitions of the string fit into 'n' characters
4. **Full Repetitions Count**: Multiply the initial count by the number of full repetitions
5. **Remaining Chara
