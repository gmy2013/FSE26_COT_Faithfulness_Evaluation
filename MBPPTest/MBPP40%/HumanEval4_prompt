def prime_num(num):
  if num >=1:
   for i in range(2, num//2):
     if (num % i) == 0:
                return False
     else:
                return True
  else:
          return False
The following is chain of thought:
The function has several issues:
1. Range should be (2, num//2+1) to include num//2
2. Returns True too early - should only return True after checking all divisors
3. Doesn't handle num=1 correctly (1 is not prime)
4. Doesn't handle n
