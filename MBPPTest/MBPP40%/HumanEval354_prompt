def is_abundant(n):
    fctrsum = sum([fctr for fctr in range(1, n) if n % fctr == 0])
    return fctrsum > n
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the task: The function `is_abundant(n)` should determine if a positive integer `n` is an abundant number.
2. Recall definition: An abundant number is one where the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number.
3. Analyze current code: 
   - It calculates `fctrsum` by summing all factors from 1 to n
