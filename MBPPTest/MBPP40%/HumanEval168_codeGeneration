CodeGeneration:
difference `set(li2) - set(li1)` to get elements in `li2` but not in `li1`.
5. Convert both resulting sets to lists.
6. Concatenate the two lists.
7. Return the concatenated list.

The function returns the symmetric difference between the two lists (elements present in only one of the lists).

Here's the complete function:

```python
def Diff(li1, li2):
    """
    Returns the symmetric difference between two lists.
    
    Parameters:
    li1 (list): First input list
    li2 (list): Second input list
    
    Returns:
    list: List containing elements that are in either li1 or li2 but not in both
    """
    return list(set(li1) - set(li2)) + list(set(li2) - set(li1))
```
