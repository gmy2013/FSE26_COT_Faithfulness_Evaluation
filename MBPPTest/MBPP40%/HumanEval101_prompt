The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given code:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The `removals` function aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from an array so that the difference between any two remaining elements is at most `k`.

2. **Sorting Strategy**: The array is sorted first to enable efficient binary search operations and to consider elements in ascending order.

3. **Binary Search Helper**: The `find_ind` function performs a binary search to find the largest index `j` such that `arr[j] - arr[i] â‰¤ k` for a given starting in
