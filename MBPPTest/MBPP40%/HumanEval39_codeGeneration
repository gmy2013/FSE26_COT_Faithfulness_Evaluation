CodeGeneration:
a closing parenthesis `[^)]+`
   - And finally a closing parenthesis `\)`
4. The function returns the result of applying this substitution to the first item only, which is incorrect since it should process all items.

Here's the corrected function that processes all items:

```python
import re
def remove_parenthesis(items):
    """Remove text within parentheses and the parentheses themselves from each string in the list.
    
    Args:
        items (list): A list of strings that may contain parentheses.
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list with the same strings but with parenthetical content removed.
    
    Examples:
        >>> remove_parenthesis(["hello (world)", "foo (bar) baz"])
        ['hello', 'foo  baz']
        >>> remove_parenthesis(["test", "no parentheses here"])
        ['test', 'no parentheses here']
    """
    result = []
    for item in items:
        cleaned = re.sub(r" ?\([^)]+\)", "", item)
        result.append(cleaned)
    return result
```
