The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the min_Swaps function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to make two binary strings identical by swapping characters within s1 only.

2. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - `c0` counts positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1'
   - `c1` counts positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'

3. **Counting Mismatches**:
   - Iterate through each character position in both strings
   - Count mismatches
