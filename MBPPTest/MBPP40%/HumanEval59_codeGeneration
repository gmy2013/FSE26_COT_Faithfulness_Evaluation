CodeGeneration:
, set `x` to -1.
3. For `y`:
   - If `r1` and `r2` are not equal, take the maximum of `r1` and `r2`.
   - If they are equal, set `y` to -1.
4. Return the tuple `(x, y)`.

The code is already implemented correctly as per the docstring and chain of thought. Here is the function:

```python
def find_Points(l1, r1, l2, r2):
    x = min(l1, l2) if (l1 != l2) else -1
    y = max(r1, r2) if (r1 != r2) else -1
    return (x, y)
```
