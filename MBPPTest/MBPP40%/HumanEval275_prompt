   else:

The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the LCM function:

1. **Input Validation**: The function takes two integer parameters x and y
2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Determine the larger of the two numbers to use as the starting point
   - If x > y, set z = x; otherwise set z = y
3. **LCM Calculation Loop**:
   - Use an infinite while loop to iterate through numbers
   - Check if the current number z is div
