def decreasing_trend(nums):
    if (sorted(nums)== nums):
        return True
    else:
        return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `decreasing_trend` is intended to check if a list of numbers is in strictly decreasing order.
2. The current implementation checks if the list is equal to its sorted version, which would only return `True` for non-decreasing (ascending) order, not decreasing.
3. To check for decreasing order, we should co
