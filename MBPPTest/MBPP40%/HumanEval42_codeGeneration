CodeGeneration:
e start or end of a word, meaning it's in the middle.
3. However, the pattern `\Bz\B` will match any 'z' that has a word character on both sides (i.e., is surrounded by word characters).
4. This correctly implements the requirement to find 'z' in the middle of a word.

Here is the complete function:

```python
import re

def text_match_wordz_middle(text):
    patterns = r'\Bz\B'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

Note: I added the raw string prefix `r` to the pattern to handle backslashes properly in regex patterns.
