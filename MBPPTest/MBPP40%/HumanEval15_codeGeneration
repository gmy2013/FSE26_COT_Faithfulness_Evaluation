her and then iterates over these pairs.
4. For each pair `(ele1, ele2)`, it computes `ele1 % ele2` (the remainder when `ele1` is divided by `ele2`).
5. The results are collected into a new tuple `res` using a tuple comprehension.
6. Finally, the function returns the resulting tuple.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def tuple_modulo(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """
    Compute the element-wise modulo operation between two tuples.

    This function takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple
    where each element is the result of the modulo operation between corresponding
    elements of the input tuples.

    Parameters:
    test_tup1 (tuple): The first input tuple containing dividend elements.
    test_tup2 (tuple): The second input tuple containing divisor elements.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple where each element is test_tup1[i] % test_tup2[i].

    Example:
    >>> tuple_modulo((10, 4, 18), (5, 3, 7))
    (0, 1, 4)
    """
    res = tuple(ele1 % ele2 for ele1, ele2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2)) 
    return res
```
