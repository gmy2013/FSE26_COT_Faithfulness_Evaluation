CodeGeneration:
6. If `x` equals `A[mid]`, update `result` to `mid` and set `right` to `mid - 1` to search for an earlier occurrence in the left half.
7. If `x` is less than `A[mid]`, set `right` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
8. If `x` is greater than `A[mid]`, set `left` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
9. After the loop, return `result`.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def find_first_occurrence(A, x):
    (left, right) = (0, len(A) - 1)
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if x == A[mid]:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif x < A[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return result
```
