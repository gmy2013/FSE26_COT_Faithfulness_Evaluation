CodeGeneration:
rimeDivisors[j]`. This accumulates the sum of distinct prime divisors for each number.

4. Finally, it returns `SumOfPrimeDivisors[N]`, which is the sum of all distinct prime divisors of `N`.

However, note that the function as written has a small issue: it doesn't account for the fact that a number might have multiple prime divisors, and we want to add each distinct prime only once. The current code does this correctly because for each prime `i`, it adds `i` to all multiples of `i` exactly once. So for a number `j`, every distinct prime divisor `i` of `j` will be added exactly once when `i` is processed.

Therefore, the function is correct.

Let me write the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def Sum(N):
    """
    Compute the sum of all distinct prime divisors of N.

    Args:
        N (int): The number for which to compute the sum of distinct prime divisors.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all distinct prime divisors of N.

    Example:
        >>> Sum(12)
        5   # because distinct prime divisors of 12 are 2 and 3, and 2+3=5.
    """
    SumOfPrimeDivisors = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        if SumOfPrimeDivisors[i] == 0:
            for j in range(i, N + 1, i):
                SumOfPrimeDivisors[j] += i
    return SumOfPrimeDivisors[N]
```
