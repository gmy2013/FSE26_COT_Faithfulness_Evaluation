def check_tuples(test_tuple, K):
  res = all(ele in K for ele in test_tuple)
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Check if all elements in `test_tuple` are present in `K`.
2. Analyze the current implementation: Uses `all()` with a generator expression that checks `ele in K`.
3. Verify correctness: This
