CodeGeneration:
mplementation already correctly returns the maximum of two numbers by comparing them and returning the larger one.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def max_of_two(x, y):
    """Return the maximum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x (int or float): First number
        y (int or float): Second number
        
    Returns:
        int or float: The larger of the two input numbers
    """
    if x > y:
        return x
    return y
```

The function works correctly by:
1. Comparing x and y
2. Returning x if it's greater than y
3. Otherwise returning y (which handles both y > x and x == y cases)
