    """
    Create a Counter with keys 'p', 'q', 'r', 's' mapped to the values of a, b, c, d respectively,
    and return a list of elements where each key appears as many times as its count value.
    
    Args:
        a (int): Count for key 'p' (must be non-negative)
        b (int): Count for key 'q' (must be non-negative)
        c (int): Count for key 'r' (must be non-negative)

    Returns:
        list: A list containing each key repeated according to its count value
    
    Example:
        >>> count_variable(2, 1, 3, 0)
        ['p', 'p', 'q', 'r', 'r', 'r']
