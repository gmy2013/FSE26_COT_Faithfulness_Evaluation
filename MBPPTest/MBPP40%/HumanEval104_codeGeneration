CodeGeneration:
I notice you've provided a function implementation and started a chain of thought, but it appears incomplete. Let me provide a complete implementation based on the function name and typical use cases:

```python
def sort_sublists(list1):
    """
    Sorts a list of sublists first by length, then lexicographically.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): A list containing sublists to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of sublists
        
    Example:
        >>> sort_sublists([[3, 2, 1], [1], [2, 1]])
        [[1], [2, 1], [3, 2, 1]]
        >>> sort_sublists([['c', 'b', 'a'], ['a'], ['b', 'a']])
        [['a'], ['b', 'a'], ['c', 'b', 'a']]
    """
    # Sort lexicographically first (inner sort)
    for sublist in list1:
        sublist.sort()
    
    # Then sort by length (outer sort)
    list1.sort(key=len)
    
    return list1
```

However, based on your initial implementation and chain of thought, it seems you might want the opposite order of operations. Here's an alternative implementation that matches your approach:

```python
def sort_sublists(list1):
    """
    Sorts a list of sublists lexicographically, then by length.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): A list containing sublists to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list of sublists
        
    Example:
        >>> sort_sublists([[3, 2, 1], [1], [2, 1]])
        [[1], [2, 1], [3, 2, 1]]
    """
    # Sort lexicographically first
    list1.sort()
    
    # Then sort by length (Python's sort is stable when using the same key)
    list1.sort(key=len)
    
    return list1
```

The key difference is whether we sort the individual sublists first (my first version) or sort the outer list lexicographically first (your version). Both approaches are valid depending on the specific requirements.
