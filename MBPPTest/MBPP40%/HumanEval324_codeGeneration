CodeGeneration:
```python
def mutiple_tuple(nums):
    temp = list(nums)
    product = 1 
    for x in temp:
        product *= x
    return product
```

The function is already complete and correctly implemented. It:
1. Takes a tuple `nums` as input
2. Converts the tuple to a list for iteration
3. Initializes `product` to 1 as the multiplicative identity
4. Iterates through each element in the list, multiplying them together
5. Returns the final product of all elements

The function will correctly calculate the product of all elements in the input tuple.
