CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def maximum_value(test_list):
    """
    Find the maximum value for each key in a list of (key, list) tuples.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): A list of tuples where each tuple contains a key and a list of numbers.
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains the original key and the maximum value from its corresponding list.
        
    Example:
        >>> maximum_value([('a', [1, 2, 3]), ('b', [4, 5, 6])])
        [('a', 3), ('b', 6)]
    """
    res = [(key, max(lst)) for key, lst in test_list]
    return res
```

The function works by:
1. Iterating through each tuple in `test_list`
2. For each tuple, extracting the key and the list of numbers
3. Using the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value in each list
4. Creating a new tuple with the original key and the maximum value
5. Returning a list of these new tuples

The list comprehension efficiently handles this transformation in a single line of code.
