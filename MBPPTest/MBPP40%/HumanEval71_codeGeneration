CodeGeneration:
num2` is greater than or equal to both `num1` and `num3` using an `elif` condition. If true, it assigns `num2` to `lnum`.
4. If both the `if` and `elif` conditions fail, it means `num3` is the largest, so it assigns `num3` to `lnum` in the `else` block.
5. Finally, it returns the value of `lnum`, which holds the maximum of the three numbers.

The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum of three numbers using conditional statements.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def max_of_three(num1, num2, num3):
    if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
        lnum = num1
    elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
        lnum = num2
    else:
        lnum = num3
    return lnum
```
