CodeGeneration:
array to store the maximum sum achievable up to each index.
5. The recurrence relation considers three possibilities at each index i:
   - Not including the current element: look_up[i-1]
   - Including the current element and the best solution from i-2: look_up[i-2] + A[i]
   - Just the current element (in case previous sums are negative): A[i]
6. The maximum of these three values is stored in look_up[i].
7. The final result is the last element of the look_up array.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def max_sum_subseq(A):
    """
    Compute the maximum sum of a subsequence where no two elements are adjacent.

    Args:
        A (list): List of integers

    Returns:
        int: Maximum sum of non-adjacent subsequence

    Examples:
        >>> max_sum_subseq([1, 2, 3, 4])
        6
        >>> max_sum_subseq([5, 1, 1, 5])
        10
        >>> max_sum_subseq([-1, -2, -3])
        -1
    """
    n = len(A)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return A[0]
    
    look_up = [None] * n
    look_up[0] = A[0]
    look_up[1] = max(A[0], A[1])
    
    for i in range(2, n):
        look_up[i] = max(look_up[i - 1], look_up[i - 2] + A[i])
        look_up[i] = max(look_up[i], A[i])
    
    return look_up[n - 1]
```

I've added:
1. A complete docstring with parameter descriptions, return type, and examples
2. A check for empty array (returns 0)
3. The dynamic programming logic as described in the chain of thought
4. The three-way comparison at each step to handle all cases including negative numbers
