def maximum_product(nums):

    Given an integer array nums, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): List of integers

    Returns:
        int: Maximum product of any three numbers in the array

    Example:
        >>> maximum_product([1, 2, 3])
        6
        >>> maximum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
        24
