CodeGeneration:
ince the non-greedy quantifier {3}? doesn't change the meaning when matching exactly 3 occurrences (it's equivalent to {3} in this case), the pattern 'ab{3}?' will match 'abbb' in the text.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
def text_match_three(text):
    patterns = 'ab{3}?'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

The function will return 'Found a match!' if the text contains 'abbb' and 'Not matched!' otherwise.
