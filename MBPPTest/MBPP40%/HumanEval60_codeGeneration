CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected implementation of the function based on the chain of thought:

```python
def max_sum_of_three_consecutive(arr, n):
    """
    Find the maximum sum of elements in an array where no three consecutive elements are selected.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        Maximum sum where no three consecutive elements are selected
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Create DP array to store maximum sums up to each index
    dp = [0] * n
    
    # Base cases
    if n >= 1:
        dp[0] = arr[0]
    if n >= 2:
        dp[1] = arr[0] + arr[1]
    if n >= 3:
        # For 3 elements, we can't take all three (they're consecutive)
        # Options: take first two, take first and third, or take last two
        dp[2] = max(arr[0] + arr[1], arr[0] + arr[2], arr[1] + arr[2])
    
    # Fill DP array for indices 3 to n-1
    for i in range(3, n):
        # Three possibilities at each step:
        # 1. Skip current element: dp[i-1]
        # 2. Take current element but skip previous: dp[i-2] + arr[i]
        # 3. Take current and previous but skip the one before: dp[i-3] + arr[i-1] + arr[i]
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + arr[i], dp[i-3] + arr[i-1] + arr[i])
    
    return dp[n-1]
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added proper docstring with parameter and return descriptions
2. Added handling for empty array case (n=0)
3. Renamed `sum` to `dp` to avoid shadowing the built-in `sum()` function
4. Fixed the base case for n=3 to properly handle the constraint of no three consecutive elements
5. Improved the recurrence relation to correctly handle all three possible scenarios at each step
6. Added comments to explain the logic at each step

The function now correctly implements the dynamic programming solution for finding the maximum sum where no three consecutive elements are selected.
