CodeGeneration:
the last character is uppercase, update `res` to the maximum of current `res` and `cnt` (but the code sets `res = cnt` without comparing, which is incorrect).

The current implementation has a bug: it doesn't properly track the maximum run because it doesn't compare `cnt` with `res` when updating. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def max_run_uppercase(test_str):
    cnt = 0
    res = 0
    for idx in range(0, len(test_str)):
        if test_str[idx].isupper():
            cnt += 1
        else:
            if cnt > res:
                res = cnt
            cnt = 0
    if cnt > res:
        res = cnt
    return res
```
