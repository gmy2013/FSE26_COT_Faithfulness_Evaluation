CodeGeneration:
ces the tuple from `idx` to `idx+2`, creating a tuple of two elements (key and value).
6. The `dict()` constructor then uses these pairs to build the dictionary.
7. Finally, the dictionary is returned.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def tuple_to_dict(test_tup):
    """
    Convert a tuple into a dictionary by grouping elements into key-value pairs.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): Input tuple containing elements to be converted to key-value pairs.
                          The tuple should have an even number of elements.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where elements at even indices become keys and elements at 
              odd indices become their corresponding values.
    
    Example:
        >>> tuple_to_dict(('a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', 3))
        {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    """
    res = dict(test_tup[idx : idx + 2] for idx in range(0, len(test_tup), 2))
    return res
```
