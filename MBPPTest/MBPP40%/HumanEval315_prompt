def find_triplet_array(A, arr_size, sum): 
	for i in range( 0, arr_size-2): 
		for j in range(i + 1, arr_size-1): 
			for k in range(j + 1, arr_size): 
				if A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == sum: 
					return  A[i],A[j],A[k] 
					return True
	return False
The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. The function `find_triplet_array` takes three parameters: an array `A`, its size `arr_size`, and a target `sum`.
2. It uses three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets (i, j, k) where i < j < k.
3. For each triplet, it checks if the sum of the three elements equals the target `sum`.
4. If a triplet is found, it returns the triplet values (A[i], A[j], A[k]) and then returns True.
5. However, there is an issue: after returning the triplet, the line `return True` is unreachable because the function already returned the triplet.
6. If no triplet is found after all iterations, it returns False.

The intended behavior seems to be:
- Return the triplet if found (or perhaps just return True to indicate existence).
- But currently, it returns the triplet values first, which makes the `return True` unreachable.

Correction needed:
- If the goal is to return the triplet when found, we should only return the triplet (and not also True).
- If the goal is to return True when a triplet exists, we should not return the tri
