The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the Odd_Length_Sum function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function calculates the sum of all elements in odd-length subarrays of the given array.

2. **Key Insight**: For each element at position i, we need to count how many odd-length subarrays include that element.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: 
   - The number of subarrays starting at position s and ending at position e that include element i is determined by the constraints s ≤ i ≤ e
   - For od
