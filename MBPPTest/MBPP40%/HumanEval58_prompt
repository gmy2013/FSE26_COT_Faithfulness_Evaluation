def Repeat(x): 
    _size = len(x) 
    repeated = [] 
    for i in range(_size): 
        k = i + 1
        for j in range(k, _size): 
            if x[i] == x[j] and x[i] not in repeated: 
                repeated.append(x[i])

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `Repeat` takes a list `x` as input.
2. It initializes `_size` to the length of the list `x`.
3. It initializes an empty list `repeated` to store elements that are repeated.
4. It uses a nested loop:
   - Outer loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `_size-1`.
   - Inner loop iterates over indices `j` from `i+1` to `_size-1`.
5.
