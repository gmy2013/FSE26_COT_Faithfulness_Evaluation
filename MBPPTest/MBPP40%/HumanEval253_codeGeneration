CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see that it's already complete and working correctly. The function:

1. Takes a list `rawheap` as input
2. Uses `heapq.heapify()` to transform it into a min-heap in-place
3. Returns the heapified list

Here's the complete function:

```python
import heapq as hq

def raw_heap(rawheap):
    hq.heapify(rawheap)
    return rawheap
```

This function will convert any list into a valid min-heap structure using Python's built-in heapq module. The heapify operation has O(n) time complexity and modifies the original list in-place.
