CodeGeneration:
The function `is_odd` correctly determines if a number is odd using bitwise operations. However, the implementation can be simplified and made more Pythonic. Here's an improved version:

```python
def is_odd(n):
    """Return True if n is odd, False otherwise.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n is odd, False if even
    """
    return bool(n & 1)
```

Alternative implementation using the original XOR approach but more concise:

```python
def is_odd(n):
    """Return True if n is odd, False otherwise.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n is odd, False if even
    """
    return (n ^ 1) == (n - 1)
```

The bitwise AND approach (`n & 1`) is generally preferred as it's more direct and commonly used for checking odd/even numbers.
