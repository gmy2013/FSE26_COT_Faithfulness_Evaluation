CodeGeneration:
number at `index` (call it `first_ludic`).
   - Calculate the first removal index as `index + first_ludic`.
   - While this removal index is within the list bounds:
        - Remove the element at that index.
        - Update the removal index by adding `first_ludic - 1` (since the list size decreases by one after each removal).
   - Increment `index` by 1.
4. **Return**: The list `ludics` now contains all Ludic numbers up to n.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    """
    Return a list of Ludic numbers less than or equal to n.

    Ludic numbers are obtained by considering the natural numbers starting from 1,
    and repeatedly removing every k-th number in the remaining set, where k is the
    first number in the remaining set (starting with k=2 for the second iteration).

    Parameters:
    n (int): Upper bound (inclusive) for Ludic numbers.

    Returns:
    list: List of Ludic numbers <= n.

    Example:
    >>> get_ludic(10)
    [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
    >>> get_ludic(25)
    [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 23, 25]
    """
    ludics = list(range(1, n + 1))
    index = 1
    while index < len(ludics):
        first_ludic = ludics[index]
        remove_index = index + first_ludic
        while remove_index < len(ludics):
            ludics.pop(remove_index)
            remove_index += first_ludic - 1
        index += 1
    return ludics
```
