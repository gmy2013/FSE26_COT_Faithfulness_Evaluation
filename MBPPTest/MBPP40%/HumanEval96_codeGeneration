CodeGeneration:
object returns an iterator, which is then converted to a list.
4. The length of this list (i.e., the number of even numbers) is assigned to `count_even`.
5. Finally, the function returns `count_even`.

However, note that the variable name `count_even` is the same as the function name. This is not a good practice because it can cause confusion and might lead to errors if the function is called recursively or if there is a need to reference the function inside itself. It is better to use a different variable name to avoid shadowing the function name.

Here is the corrected code with a different variable name:

```python
def count_even(array_nums):
    count = len(list(filter(lambda x: (x % 2 == 0), array_nums)))
    return count
```

Alternatively, for clarity and to avoid potential issues, we can use a list comprehension which is often more readable in Python:

```python
def count_even(array_nums):
    count = len([x for x in array_nums if x % 2 == 0])
    return count
```

Both versions achieve the same result. The list comprehension might be preferred for its readability.
