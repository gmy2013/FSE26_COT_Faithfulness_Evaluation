def are_Equal(arr1,arr2,n,m):
    if (n != m):
        return False
    arr1.sort()
    arr2.sort()
    for i in range(0,n - 1):
        if (arr1[i] != arr2[i]):
            return False
    return True
The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if the lengths of the arrays are different (n != m)
   - If true, arrays cannot be equal, return False immediately
2. Sort both arrays to bring elements into comparable order
3. Iterate through both sorted arrays using index i from 0 to n-1
