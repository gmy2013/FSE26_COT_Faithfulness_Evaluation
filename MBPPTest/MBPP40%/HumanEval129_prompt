from itertools import groupby
def consecutive_duplicates(nums):
    return [key for key, group in groupby(nums)] 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `consecutive_duplicates` takes a list `nums` as input.
2. It uses `itertools.groupby` to group consecutive duplicate elements together.
3. For each group of consecutive duplicates, `groupby` returns a tuple `(key, group)` where `key` is the element val
