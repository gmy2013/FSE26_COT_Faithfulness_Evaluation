The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given code:

1. **Function Analysis - factorial(start, end):**
   - This function calculates the product of all integers from `start` to `end` inclusive.
   - It initializes `res` to 1.
   - It iterates through each integer in the range [start, end] and multiplies them together.
   - Returns the cumulative product.

2. **Function Analysis - sum_of_square(n):**
   - This function appears to compute a mathematical expression involving factorials.
   - It calculates `factorial(n + 1, 2 * n) / factorial(1, n)`.
   - The numerator is the product of integers from (n+1) to (2n).
   - The denominator is the product of integers from 1 to n (which is n!).
   - The expression simplifies to (2n)!/(n! * n!) / n? Wait, let's check the mathematical identity.

3. **Mathematical Identity Recognition:**
   - `factorial(n+1, 2n)` = (n+1)*(n+2)*...*(2n) = (2n)! / n!
   - So numerator = (2n)! / n!
   - Denominator = n! (since factorial(1, n) = n!)
   - Therefore, the expression becomes: [(2n)! / n!] / n! = (2n)! / (
