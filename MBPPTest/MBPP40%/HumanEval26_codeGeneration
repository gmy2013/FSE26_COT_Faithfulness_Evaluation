CodeGeneration:
inary Search Setup**: Calculate the midpoint of the current range
   - This divides the problem into smaller subproblems for efficient search

4. **Recursive Cases**:
   - If array[mid] == mid: All numbers from start to mid are present
     - Search the right half (mid+1 to end) for the first missing number
   - If array[mid] â‰  mid: There's a missing number in the left half
     - Search the left half (start to mid) for the first missing number

Here's the complete function with the chain of thought incorporated:

```python
def find_First_Missing(array, start, end):
    """
    Find the smallest missing non-negative integer in a sorted array of distinct integers.
    
    The function uses a binary search approach to efficiently locate the first
    missing number where array[i] != i.
    
    Args:
        array: Sorted list of distinct integers
        start: Starting index of the search range
        end: Ending index of the search range
    
    Returns:
        The first missing non-negative integer in the sequence
    
    Example:
        >>> find_First_Missing([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9], 0, 6)
        5
        >>> find_First_Missing([0, 1, 2, 3], 0, 3)
        4
        >>> find_First_Missing([1, 2, 3, 4], 0, 3)
        0
    """
    # Base Case 1: If start exceeds end, the entire range is properly sequenced
    # The first missing number is end + 1 (next integer after last element)
    if start > end:
        return end + 1
    
    # Base Case 2: If the first element doesn't match its index
    # The first missing number is the start index itself
    if start != array[start]:
        return start
    
    # Calculate midpoint for binary search
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    
    # If the midpoint value equals its index, all numbers from start to mid are present
    # Search the right half for the first missing number
    if array[mid] == mid:
        return find_First_Missing(array, mid + 1, end)
    
    # Otherwise, there's a missing number in the left half
    # Search the left half (including mid) for the first missing number
    return find_First_Missing(array, start, mid)
```
