CodeGeneration:
r = s * l
4. The function returns the perimeter.

The provided implementation is correct and complete. Here's the function as given:

```python
from math import tan, pi

def perimeter_polygon(s, l):
    perimeter = s * l
    return perimeter
```

However, I notice that `tan` and `pi` are imported from math but not used in this function. If this is intentional for other calculations, the code is fine. If these imports are not needed for this specific function, they could be removed to keep the code clean.
