CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and your chain of thought, here's the complete function:

```python
def mul_even_odd(list1):
    """
    Multiply the first even and first odd numbers in the list.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): List of integers
        
    Returns:
        int: Product of first even and first odd numbers, or -1 if either is not found
    """
    first_even = next((el for el in list1 if el % 2 == 0), -1)
    first_odd = next((el for el in list1 if el % 2 != 0), -1)
    return first_even * first_odd
```

The function:
1. Uses generator expressions with `next()` to find the first even and first odd numbers
2. Returns -1 as default if no even or odd number is found
3. Returns the product of the first even and first odd numbers found
4. Handles edge cases where either even or odd numbers might not exist in the list
