The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function checks if a number has odd parity (odd number of 1-bits in its binary representation)

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `parity = 0` - counter to track the number of 1-bits

3. **Bit Counting Loop**:
   - `while (x != 0)` - conti
