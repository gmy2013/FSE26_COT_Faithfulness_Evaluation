The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `word_len(s)` takes a string `s` as input.
2. The string is split into a list of words using space as the delimiter.
3. The function iterates through each word in the list.
4. For the first word, it checks if the length is even (divisible by 2).
5. If the first word has even length, it immediately returns `True`.
6. If the first word has odd length, it
