nd `n`.
3. The provided code uses `filter` with a lambda function that checks if a number `x` is divisible by both `m` and `n` (i.e., `x % m == 0 and x % n == 0`).
4. The `filter` object is converted to a list and returned.

The code is correct and efficient for the task. Here is the complete function:

```python
def div_of_nums(nums, m, n):
    """Return a list of numbers from nums that are divisible by both m and n.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of numbers to filter.
        m (int): First divisor.
        n (int): Second divisor.
    
    Returns:
        list: Numbers divisible by both m and n.
    """
    result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 and x % n == 0), nums)) 
    return result
```
