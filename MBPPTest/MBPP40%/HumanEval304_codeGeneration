CodeGeneration:
(n!)^2

However, the function is named `sum_of_squares`, but this expression actually computes the central binomial coefficient, which is C(2n, n) = (2n)!/(n!)^2.

For the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, the correct formula is:
sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def sum_of_square(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of natural numbers to sum squares of
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2
    """
    return n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6
```

The original implementation was mathematically incorrect for calculating the sum of squares, though it correctly computes the central binomial coefficient C(2n, n).
