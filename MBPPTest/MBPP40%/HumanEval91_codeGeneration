CodeGeneration:
I see the issue. The function incorrectly returns early for N >= 10, but we should compute the last two digits of factorial for any non-negative integer N. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def last_Two_Digits(N):
    """
    Compute the last two digits of N! (factorial of N).
    
    Args:
        N (int): A non-negative integer
        
    Returns:
        int: The last two digits of N! (00 to 99)
    """
    if N < 0:
        raise ValueError("N must be a non-negative integer")
    
    if N == 0 or N == 1:
        return 1
    
    fac = 1
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        fac = (fac * i) % 100
    
    return fac
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the incorrect early return condition for N >= 10
2. Added proper input validation for negative numbers
3. Added special case handling for N = 0 and N = 1 (0! = 1, 1! = 1)
4. Optimized the loop to start from 2 instead of 1
5. Added proper docstring documentation

This function now correctly computes the last two digits of N! for any non-negative integer N by using modulo 100 arithmetic to prevent integer overflow and efficiently extract just the last two digits.
