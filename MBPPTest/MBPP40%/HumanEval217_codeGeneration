CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with improved formatting and clarity:

```python
def lower_ctr(str):
    lower_ctr = 0
    for i in range(len(str)):
        if str[i] >= 'a' and str[i] <= 'z':
            lower_ctr += 1
    return lower_ctr
```

The function counts the number of lowercase letters in a string by:
1. Initializing a counter to 0
2. Iterating through each character using index positions
3. Checking if each character is between 'a' and 'z' (lowercase letters)
4. Incrementing the counter for each lowercase letter found
5. Returning the final count

Alternative implementation using more Pythonic style:
```python
def lower_ctr(s):
    return sum(1 for char in s if 'a' <= char <= 'z')
```
