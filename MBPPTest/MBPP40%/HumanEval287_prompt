def substract_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
   for tup1, tup2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for completing the function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function needs to subtract corresponding elements from two nested tuples (test_tup1 and test_tup2) element-wise
2. **Input Structure**: Both inputs are tuples containing tuples (nested structure with equal dimensions)
3. **Operation Required**: For each corresponding inner tuple pair, subtract elements at the same positions
4. **Iteration Strategy**: Use neste
