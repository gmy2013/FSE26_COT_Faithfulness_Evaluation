def sum_num(numbers):
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    return total/len(numbers) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. Analyze the function name and docstring: The function is named `sum_num`, which suggests it performs a summation operation.
2. Read the code: 
   - Initialize `total` to 0.
   - Iterate over each element `x` in `numbers`, adding it to `total`.
   - Return `total / len(numbers)`.
3. Identify the operation: The code calculates the sum of all elements and then divides by the count, which computes th
