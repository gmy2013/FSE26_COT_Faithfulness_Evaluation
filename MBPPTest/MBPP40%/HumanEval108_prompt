The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function takes a list of tuples and returns a dictionary showing the count of unique first elements for each second element

2. **Data Structure**: Uses defaultdict(list) to efficiently group elements by their second value

3. **Grouping Logic**: 
   - Iterates through each tuple in the input list
   - Uses the second element (sub[1]) as key
   - Appends the fi
