The following is chain of thought:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `sum_Square(n)` checks whether a given integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares.
2. **Initialization**: Start with `i = 1` to iterate through possible first squares.
3. **Outer Loop**: Continue while `i*i <= n` to ensure the square of `i` does not exceed `n`.
4. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, initialize `j = 1` and iterate while `j*j <
