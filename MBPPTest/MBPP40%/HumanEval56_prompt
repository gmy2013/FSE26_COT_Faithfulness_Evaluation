The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the function step by step:

1. **Initialization**: Start with `fact = 1` (base for factorial calculation).
2. **Compute factorial with trailing zero removal**:
   - For each integer `i` from 2 to `n` (inclusive):
     - Multiply `fact` by `i`.
     - While the last digit of `fact` is zero (i.e., `fact % 10 == 0`), remove that zero by integer division by 10.
   - This prevents the number from becoming too large and removes trailing zeros that don't affect the first non-zero digit.
3. **Extract the first digit**:
   - After computing the factorial (with trailing zeros rem
