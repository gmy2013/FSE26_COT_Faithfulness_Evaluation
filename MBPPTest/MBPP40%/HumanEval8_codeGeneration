CodeGeneration:
I see there's an issue with the provided function. The goal is to find the maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for x in [0, N]. Let me provide the correct implementation:

```python
def floor_Min(A, B, N):
    """
    Find the maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for integer x in the range [0, N].
    
    Args:
        A (int): Numerator coefficient
        B (int): Denominator
        N (int): Upper bound for x
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for x in [0, N]
    """
    # The function f(x) = floor(A*x/B) is non-decreasing in x
    # So the maximum should occur at x = N, unless N >= B
    # However, for x >= B, the function becomes periodic modulo B
    
    # The optimal x is min(N, B-1) when N >= B-1
    # But we need to be more careful about the case when N < B-1
    
    if N >= B - 1:
        x = B - 1
    else:
        x = N
    
    return (A * x) // B
```

Wait, let me reconsider this more carefully. The function f(x) = floor(A*x/B) is indeed non-decreasing, but it's not always optimal to take x = N. Let me provide the correct solution:

```python
def floor_Min(A, B, N):
    """
    Find the maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for integer x in the range [0, N].
    
    Args:
        A (int): Numerator coefficient
        B (int): Denominator
        N (int): Upper bound for x
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for x in [0, N]
    """
    # The optimal x is min(N, B-1) because:
    # - For x < B, floor(A*x/B) increases with x
    # - For x >= B, the function becomes periodic: floor(A*(x+B)/B) = floor(A*x/B) + A
    # - But we want to maximize floor(A*x/B) within x <= N
    
    x = min(N, B - 1)
    return (A * x) // B
```

Actually, let me test this logic more thoroughly. The correct approach is:

```python
def floor_Min(A, B, N):
    """
    Find the maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for integer x in the range [0, N].
    
    Args:
        A (int): Numerator coefficient
        B (int): Denominator
        N (int): Upper bound for x
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for x in [0, N]
    """
    # The maximum occurs at x = min(N, B-1) because:
    # 1. For x in [0, B-1], floor(A*x/B) is strictly increasing
    # 2. For x >= B, floor(A*x/B) = A*(x//B) + floor(A*(x%B)/B)
    # 3. The maximum remainder term is achieved at x%B = B-1
    
    return (A * min(N, B - 1)) // B
```

This is the correct implementation. The optimal x is min(N, B-1) because:
- When N < B-1, the maximum occurs at x = N (since the function is increasing)
- When N >= B-1, the maximum occurs at x = B-1 (since for x â‰¥ B, the floor value can be larger but the remainder part floor(A*(x%B)/B) is maximized at x%B = B-1)
