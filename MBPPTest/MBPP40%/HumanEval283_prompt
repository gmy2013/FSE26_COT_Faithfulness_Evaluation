The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Understand the problem**: Check if all bits in the range [l, r] (inclusive) of number n are set to 1
2. **Create a bitmask**:
   - Generate a mask with all bits set from position 1 to r: `(1 << r) - 1`
   - Generate a mask with all bits set fro
