CodeGeneration:
s)` to transpose the list of tuples, grouping elements by their positions.
4. For each group (which is a tuple of elements from the same position), compute the average by summing and dividing by the number of elements.
5. Return the list of averages.

The provided code already correctly implements this logic. Here is the complete function:

```python
def average_tuple(nums):
    """Compute the average of elements at each position across all tuples.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of tuples containing numbers.
        
    Returns:
        List of averages for each position.
        
    Example:
        >>> average_tuple([(10, 10, 10), (30, 45, 56), (81, 80, 39), (1, 2, 3)])
        [30.5, 34.25, 27.0]
    """
    result = [sum(x) / len(x) for x in zip(*nums)]
    return result
```
