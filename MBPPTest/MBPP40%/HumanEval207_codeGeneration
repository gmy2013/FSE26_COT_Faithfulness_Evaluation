CodeGeneration:
e through each element in the tuple `test_tup`.
4. For each element, check if it is equal to `K`.
5. If a match is found, set `res` to `True` and break out of the loop early (since we found the value).
6. After the loop, return the value of `res`.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def check_K(test_tup, K):
    res = False
    for ele in test_tup:
        if ele == K:
            res = True
            break
    return res
```
