CodeGeneration:
mpiled once, which is efficient if the function is called multiple times.
4. The `match` method checks if the pattern matches the beginning of the string.
5. If there's a match, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function is correct and follows best practices for regex matching in Python. Here's the complete function:

```python
import re
def match_num(string):
    text = re.compile(r"^5")
    if text.match(string):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
