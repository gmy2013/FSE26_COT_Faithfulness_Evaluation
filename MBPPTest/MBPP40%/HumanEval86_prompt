def recur_gcd(a, b):

	if low == 0:

The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the `recur_gcd` function:

1. **Input Validation**: The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input
2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Find the smaller value using `min(a, b)` and store in `low`
   - Find the larger value using `max(a, b)` and store in `high`
3. **Base Case 1**: If `low == 0`, return `high` (GCD of any numbe
