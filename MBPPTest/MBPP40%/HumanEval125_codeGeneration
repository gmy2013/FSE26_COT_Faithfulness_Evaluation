CodeGeneration:
up[1:])` to pair each element with the next one.
4. Then, we use a generator expression to multiply each pair (i, j) and create the resulting tuple.
5. Finally, we return the result.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def multiply_elements(test_tup):
    """
    Multiply consecutive elements in the given tuple.

    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): Input tuple of numbers.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple where each element is the product of consecutive pairs
               from the input tuple.

    Examples:
        >>> multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))
        (5, 35, 56, 80)
        >>> multiply_elements((2, 4, 5, 6, 7))
        (8, 20, 30, 42)
    """
    res = tuple(i * j for i, j in zip(test_tup, test_tup[1:]))
    return res
```
