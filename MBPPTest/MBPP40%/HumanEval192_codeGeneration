   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`
   - If `arr[mid] > x`: search left half by setting `high = mid - 1`
   - If `arr[mid] < x`: search right half by setting `low = mid + 1`
   - If `arr[mid] == x`: update `res` to `mid` and continue searching right half for later occurrences by setting `low = mid + 1`

4. **Return Result**: After the loop, return `res` which holds the index of the last occurrence, or -1 if not found

The function correctly implements a modified binary search to find the last occurrence of `x` in a sorted array.

```python
def last(arr, x, n):
    """
    Find the last occurrence of element x in a sorted array arr of size n.
    
    Args:
        arr: Sorted list of elements
        x: Element to search for
        n: Size of the array
    
    Returns:
        int: Index of the last occurrence of x, or -1 if not found
    """
    low = 0
    high = n - 1
    res = -1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            res = mid
            low = mid + 1
    
    return res
```
