CodeGeneration:
ramming Approach**:
   - For each pair at index i (starting from 1), compare with all previous pairs at index j
   - If the current pair's first element (arr[i].a) is greater than the previous pair's second element (arr[j].b)
     AND the chain length through j would be longer than the current chain length at i
   - Update mcl[i] to be mcl[j] + 1

4. **Find Maximum**: After processing all pairs, find the maximum value in the mcl array

5. **Return Result**: Return the maximum chain length found
