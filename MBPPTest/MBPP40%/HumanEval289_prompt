def find_Extra(arr1,arr2,n) : 
    for i in range(0, n) : 
        if (arr1[i] != arr2[i]) : 
            return i 
    return n 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the find_Extra function:

1. **Function Purpose**: Identify the index position where two arrays first differ, assuming one array has an extra element at the end

2. **Input Analysis**:
   - arr1: First array (longer array with n+1 elements)
   - arr2: Second array (shorter array with n elements)
   - n: Length of the shorter array (arr2)

3. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - Use linear search to compare elements at each index
   - Iterate through indices 0 to n-1
