CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the corrected docstring:

```python
def swap_List(newList):
    """
    Swap the first and last elements of a list.
    
    Args:
        newList (list): The input list to be modified
        
    Returns:
        list: The modified list with first and last elements swapped
        
    Example:
        >>> swap_List([1, 2, 3, 4])
        [4, 2, 3, 1]
        >>> swap_List(['a', 'b', 'c'])
        ['c', 'b', 'a']
    """
    size = len(newList) 
    temp = newList[0] 
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1] 
    newList[size - 1] = temp   
    return newList
```

The function works by:
1. Getting the length of the list
2. Storing the first element in a temporary variable
3. Replacing the first element with the last element
4. Replacing the last element with the temporary value (original first element)
5. Returning the modified list

This effectively swaps the first and last elements of the input list in place.
