CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the corrected docstring and implementation:

```python
def count_Char(str, x):
    """
    Count occurrences of character 'x' in the first 'n' characters of a repeated string.
    
    Args:
        str (string): The input string to be repeated
        x (char): The character to count occurrences of
        n (int): The number of characters to consider in the repeated string
    
    Returns:
        int: The count of character 'x' in the first 'n' characters
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(str)):  
        if (str[i] == x): 
            count += 1
    
    n = 10  # This should be a parameter, not hardcoded
    repititions = n // len(str)  
    count = count * repititions  
    l = n % len(str)  
    
    for i in range(l): 
        if (str[i] == x):  
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

However, I notice that `n` is hardcoded to 10, which contradicts the function's purpose. Here's the corrected version where `n` is a proper parameter:

```python
def count_Char(str, x, n):
    """
    Count occurrences of character 'x' in the first 'n' characters of a repeated string.
    
    Args:
        str (string): The input string to be repeated
        x (char): The character to count occurrences of
        n (int): The number of characters to consider in the repeated string
    
    Returns:
        int: The count of character 'x' in the first 'n' characters
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(str)):  
        if (str[i] == x): 
            count += 1
    
    repetitions = n // len(str)  
    count = count * repetitions  
    remaining = n % len(str)  
    
    for i in range(remaining): 
        if (str[i] == x):  
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

The function now properly:
1. Counts occurrences of 'x' in the original string
2. Calculates how many full repetitions fit into 'n' characters
3. Multiplies the count by the number of full repetitions
4. Handles the remaining characters from a partial repetition
5. Returns the total count
