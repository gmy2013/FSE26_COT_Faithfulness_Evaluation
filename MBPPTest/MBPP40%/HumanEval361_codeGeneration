CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, I understand the issue and the intended functionality. The current implementation has a misleading function name but actually computes the sum of even numbers correctly when used appropriately. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def sum_even_numbers(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the first n even numbers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of even terms to sum
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of first n even numbers = n*(n+1)
    """
    return n * (n + 1)


def sum_Even(l, r):
    """
    Calculate the sum of even numbers between l and r (inclusive).
    
    Args:
        l (int): Lower bound (inclusive)
        r (int): Upper bound (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of even numbers in range [l, r]
    """
    # Number of even terms up to r: floor(r/2)
    # Number of even terms up to (l-1): floor((l-1)/2)
    k_r = r // 2
    k_l = (l - 1) // 2
    
    return sum_even_numbers(k_r) - sum_even_numbers(k_l)
```

The key changes made:
1. Renamed `sum_Natural` to `sum_even_numbers` to accurately reflect what it computes
2. Used integer division (`//`) instead of `int()` for clarity and efficiency
3. Added proper docstrings explaining each function's purpose
4. Maintained the mathematical correctness: sum of even numbers in [l, r] = sum of first floor(r/2) even numbers - sum of first floor((l-1)/2) even numbers

The original implementation was mathematically correct for summing even numbers, but the function naming was misleading.
