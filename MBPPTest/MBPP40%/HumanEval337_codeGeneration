CodeGeneration:
rrent triplet (A[i], B[j], C[k]).
     - If the range (maximum - minimum) is smaller than the current `diff`, update `diff` and store the current indices.
     - If `diff` becomes 0, break early as no smaller range is possible.
     - Increment the pointer pointing to the smallest value among the three to potentially find a smaller range.

3. **Return result**:
   - Return the triplet (A[res_i], B[res_j], C[res_k]) that has the smallest range.

Here is the complete function:

```python
import sys 

def find_closet(A, B, C, p, q, r): 
    diff = sys.maxsize 
    res_i = 0
    res_j = 0
    res_k = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = 0
    while(i < p and j < q and k < r): 
        minimum = min(A[i], min(B[j], C[k])) 
        maximum = max(A[i], max(B[j], C[k]))
        if maximum - minimum < diff: 
            res_i = i 
            res_j = j 
            res_k = k 
            diff = maximum - minimum
        if diff == 0: 
            break
        if A[i] == minimum: 
            i += 1
        elif B[j] == minimum: 
            j += 1
        else: 
            k += 1
    return A[res_i], B[res_j], C[res_k]
```
