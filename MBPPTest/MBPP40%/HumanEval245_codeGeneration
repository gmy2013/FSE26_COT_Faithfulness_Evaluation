6. Compare the current arrival time (`arr[i]`) with the current departure time (`dep[j]`):
   - If arrival time is less than or equal to departure time, it means a new train arrives before the previous one departs, so increment `plat_needed` and move to the next arrival.
   - Otherwise, a train has departed, so decrement `plat_needed` and move to the next departure.
7. Update `result` to the maximum value of `plat_needed` encountered during the process.
8. Return `result` which represents the minimum number of platforms required.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

        dep: List of departure times of trains
