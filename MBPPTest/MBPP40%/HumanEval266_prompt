    for i in range(n):

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `min_Num` takes two parameters: an array `arr` and its length `n`.
2. Initialize a variable `odd` to 0 to count the number of odd elements in the array.
3. Iterate through each element in the array using a for loop from index 0 to n-1.
4. For each el
