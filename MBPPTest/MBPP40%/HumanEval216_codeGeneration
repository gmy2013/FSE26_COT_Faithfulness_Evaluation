CodeGeneration:
isible by `n`.
3. The provided implementation uses `filter` with a lambda function that checks if `x % m == 0` OR `x % n == 0`.
4. This correctly implements the requirement to filter numbers divisible by either `m` or `n`.
5. The filtered result is converted to a list and returned.

The implementation is correct and complete. No changes are needed.

```python
def div_of_nums(nums, m, n):
    """Return a list of numbers from nums that are divisible by m or n.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of numbers
        m: First divisor
        n: Second divisor
    
    Returns:
        List of numbers divisible by m or n
    """
    result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 or x % n == 0), nums))
    return result
```
