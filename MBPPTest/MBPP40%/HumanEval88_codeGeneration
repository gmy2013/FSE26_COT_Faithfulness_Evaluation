Here's the complete function with the corrected implementation:

```python
def min_jumps(arr, n):
    """
    Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        Minimum number of jumps to reach arr[n-1] from arr[0], or float('inf') if unreachable
    """
    jumps = [0 for i in range(n)]
    if (n == 0) or (arr[0] == 0):
        return float('inf')
    
    jumps[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        jumps[i] = float('inf')
        for j in range(i):
            if (i <= j + arr[j]) and (jumps[j] != float('inf')):
                jumps[i] = min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1)
                break
    
    return jumps[n-1]
```

The function implements a dynamic programming approach to find the minimum jumps needed:
1. Initializes a jumps array to store minimum jumps to reach each position
2. Handles edge cases where the array is empty or starting position has 0 jump capacity
3. Uses nested loops to check all possible paths from previous positions to current position
4. Returns the minimum jumps needed to reach the last element, or infinity if unreachable

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) and space complexity is O(n).
