CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided chain of thought and the function's purpose, here's the complete function:

```python
def is_key_present(d, x):
    """
    Check if a key exists in a dictionary.
    
    Args:
        d (dict): The dictionary to search in
        x: The key to check for existence in the dictionary
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the key is found in the dictionary, False otherwise
    """
    if x in d:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The function efficiently checks for key existence using Python's `in` operator with dictionaries, which has O(1) average time complexity for this operation.
