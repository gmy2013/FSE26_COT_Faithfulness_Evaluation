CodeGeneration:
I notice there's an issue with the function you provided. The second `replace` and `return` statements are unreachable because the function returns after the first replacement. Here's the corrected version:

```python
import re

text = 'Python Exercises'

def replace_spaces(text):
    """
    Replace all spaces in the input text with underscores.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string containing spaces
        
    Returns:
        str: The input string with spaces replaced by underscores
    """
    text = text.replace(" ", "_")
    return text
```

The corrected function:
1. Takes the input text parameter
2. Replaces all spaces with underscores using the `replace()` method
3. Returns the modified string
4. Removes the unreachable code that was trying to convert underscores back to spaces

You can use it like this:
```python
result = replace_spaces('Python Exercises')
print(result)  # Output: 'Python_Exercises'
```
