g (`$` anchor).
3. However, the pattern does not allow any other characters before or after, meaning the entire string must consist only of uppercase followed by lowercase letters.
4. The function returns 'Found a match!' if the pattern is found, otherwise 'Not matched!'.

Let me test the function with some examples to ensure it works as expected.

Example 1: "Hello" -> matches because it starts with uppercase 'H' and then lowercase 'ello'
Example 2: "HELLO" -> does not match because there are no lowercase letters after the uppercase
Example 3: "hello" -> does not match because it doesn't start with uppercase
Example 4: "Hello World" -> does not match because of the space and additional word
Example 5: "A" -> does not match because there must be at least one lowercase letter after the uppercase
Example 6: "a" -> does not match because it doesn't start with uppercase
Example 7: "Aa" -> matches
Example 8: "AA" -> does not match (no lowercase)
Example 9: "aa" -> does not match (no uppercase at start)
Example 10: "Hello123" -> does not match (contains digits)

The function seems correct based on the pattern. No changes needed.

```python
import re
def text_uppercase_lowercase(text):
        patterns = '[A-Z]+[a-z]+$'
        if re.search(patterns, text):
                return 'Found a match!'
        else:
                return ('Not matched!')
```
