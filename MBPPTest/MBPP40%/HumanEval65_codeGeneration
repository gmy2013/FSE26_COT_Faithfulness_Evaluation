CodeGeneration:
in the string using a for loop with `range(len(string))`.
4. For each index, check if the character at that index equals `char`.
5. If it matches, increment `count` by 1.
6. After the loop, return the total count.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def count_char(string, char):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == char:
            count += 1
    return count
```
