Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def count_Set_Bits(n):
    """
    Count the total number of set bits (1s) in the binary representations 
    of all numbers from 0 to n.
    
    This function uses an efficient algorithm that processes each bit position
    separately rather than counting bits in each number individually.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound (inclusive) of the range [0, n]
    
    Returns:
        int: Total count of set bits in all numbers from 0 to n
    """
    n += 1  # Include 0 in the count
    powerOf2 = 2
    cnt = n // 2  # Each odd number contributes 1 set bit at the LSB position
    
    while powerOf2 <= n:
        totalPairs = n // powerOf2
        cnt += (totalPairs // 2) * powerOf2
        
        if totalPairs & 1:
            cnt += (n % powerOf2)
        
        powerOf2 <<= 1
    
    return cnt
```

The algorithm works by:
1. **Initial setup**: Counting the least significant bits (each odd number contributes 1)
2. **Processing each bit position**: For each power of 2 (bit position), it calculates:
   - How many complete pairs of 0s and 1s exist at that position
   - Any remaining partial pair that contributes additional set bits
3. **Efficiency**: O(log n) time complexity instead of O(n) for brute force approaches

This approach is much more efficient than iterating through each number and counting its bits individually, especially for large values of n.
