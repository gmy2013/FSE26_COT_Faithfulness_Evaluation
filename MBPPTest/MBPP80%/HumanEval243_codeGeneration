CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the provided docstring and chain of thought. The function creates an array with odd numbers first, then even numbers, and returns the k-th element.

```python
def get_Number(n, k):
    """
    Returns the k-th element in a sequence where all odd numbers (in ascending order)
    come first, followed by all even numbers (in ascending order).

    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound for numbers in the sequence
        k (int): The position to return (1-indexed)

    Returns:
        int: The k-th element in the sequence

    Example:
        >>> get_Number(5, 1)
        1
        >>> get_Number(5, 3)
        5
        >>> get_Number(5, 4)
        2
        >>> get_Number(6, 6)
        6
    """
    arr = [0] * n
    i = 0
    odd = 1
    while (odd <= n):   
        arr[i] = odd
        i += 1
        odd += 2
    even = 2
    while (even <= n):
        arr[i] = even
        i += 1
        even += 2
    return arr[k - 1]
```

The function works as described:
1. Creates an array of length `n` initialized with zeros
2. First fills the array with odd numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
3. Then fills the remaining positions with even numbers from 2 to n (inclusive)
4. Returns the element at position `k-1` (converting from 1-indexed to 0-indexed)
