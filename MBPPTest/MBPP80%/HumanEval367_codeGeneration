CodeGeneration:
maximum possible within the given constraint.

Here is the complete function with the thought process incorporated:

```python
def floor_Max(A, B, N):
    """
    Compute the maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for x in the range [0, N].
    
    The maximum occurs at x = min(B-1, N) because:
    - For x >= B, the floor function may cause the value to drop due to modulo effects
    - Therefore, the optimal x is constrained to be at most B-1
    - If N is less than B-1, then x = N is the maximum possible
    
    Args:
        A (int): Numerator coefficient
        B (int): Denominator
        N (int): Maximum value of x
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum value of floor((A*x)/B) for x in [0, N]
    """
    x = min(B - 1, N)
    return (A * x) // B
```
