The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_duplicate` takes a string as input.
2. The goal is to remove duplicate words while preserving the original order of first occurrences.
3. The function splits the input string into words using `string.split()`.
4. It creates an `OrderedDict` where each word is both key and value, which automatically removes duplicates while maintaining insertion order.
5. The keys of the OrderedDict (unique words in order) are joined
