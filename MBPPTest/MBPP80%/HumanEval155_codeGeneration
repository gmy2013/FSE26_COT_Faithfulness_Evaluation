CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the chain of thought, the function appears to be correctly implemented. However, I notice the docstring is missing from the provided code. Here's the complete function with the appropriate docstring:

```python
import re

def text_match_zero_one(text):
    """
    Check if the input text contains the pattern 'ab?'.
    
    The regex pattern 'ab?' means:
    - 'a' followed by
    - 'b' zero or one time (the '?' quantifier makes 'b' optional)
    So it will match either 'a' or 'ab'
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to search for the pattern
        
    Returns:
        str: 'Found a match!' if pattern is found, 'Not matched!' otherwise
    """
    patterns = 'ab?'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

The function is already correctly implemented as:
1. It imports the `re` module for regular expressions
2. It defines the pattern `'ab?'` which matches either 'a' or 'ab'
3. It uses `re.search()` to check if the pattern exists anywhere in the input text
4. It returns the appropriate message based on whether the pattern is found or not

The function will work as expected for the described behavior.
