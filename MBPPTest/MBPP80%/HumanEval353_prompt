def profit_amount(actual_cost,sale_amount): 
 if(actual_cost > sale_amount):
    amount = actual_cost - sale_amount
    return amount
 else:
    return None
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `profit_amount` takes two parameters: `actual_cost` and `sale_amount`.
2. The goal is to calculate the profit amount when `actual_cost` is greater than `sale_amount`.
3. If `actual_cost` > `sale_amount`, compute the difference (actual_cost - sale_amount) and return it.
4. If `actual_cost` <= `sale_amount`, return `None` (indicating no profit or loss).
5. The code correctly implements this logic with an if-
