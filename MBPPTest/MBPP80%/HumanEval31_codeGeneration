CodeGeneration:
5. Return the result: Return the modified list `x` with zeros moved to the end.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def move_zero(num_list):
    """Move all zeros in the given list to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
    
    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of integers that may contain zeros
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list with all zeros moved to the end, preserving the order of non-zero elements
    """
    a = [0 for i in range(num_list.count(0))]
    x = [i for i in num_list if i != 0]
    x.extend(a)
    return x
```

The function works by:
1. Counting the zeros in the input list
2. Creating a list of zeros of the same count
3. Filtering out all non-zero elements from the original list
4. Appending the zeros to the end of the filtered list
5. Returning the result with zeros moved to the end while preserving the order of non-zero elements
