CodeGeneration:
Given the docstring and the chain of thought, I can see that the function is already implemented correctly. However, to make it more efficient and handle edge cases better, I can optimize it by starting from the largest possible value and breaking early when found, or by using mathematical operations to avoid iterating through all numbers.

Here's an optimized version:

```python
import sys

def find_max_val(n, x, y):
    """
    Find the maximum value k in the range [0, n] such that k % x == y.
    If no such k exists, return -1.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound of the range (inclusive).
        x (int): The divisor for the modulo operation.
        y (int): The remainder to check for.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum k satisfying the condition, or -1 if not found.
    """
    # Handle invalid cases: if x is 0 (division by zero) or y is not in [0, x-1]
    if x == 0:
        return -1
    if y < 0 or y >= x:
        return -1

    # The largest number <= n that satisfies k % x == y is:
    # k = n - (n % x) + y, but if this exceeds n, subtract x
    candidate = n - (n % x) + y
    if candidate > n:
        candidate -= x

    # Check if candidate is non-negative and satisfies the condition
    if candidate >= 0 and candidate <= n and candidate % x == y:
        return candidate
    else:
        return -1
```

This optimized version avoids the loop and directly computes the maximum value `k` that satisfies the condition, making it much more efficient, especially for large `n`.
