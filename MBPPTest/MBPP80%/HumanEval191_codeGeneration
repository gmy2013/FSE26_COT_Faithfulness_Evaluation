CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, the function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with proper docstring formatting:

```python
def count_list(input_list):
    """Return the number of elements in the input list.
    
    Args:
        input_list: A list whose elements should be counted
        
    Returns:
        int: The number of elements in the input list
    """
    return len(input_list)
```

The function correctly uses Python's built-in `len()` function to count the number of elements in the input list, which is the most efficient and straightforward way to implement this functionality.
