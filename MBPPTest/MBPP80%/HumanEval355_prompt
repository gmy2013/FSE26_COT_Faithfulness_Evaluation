def split_list(text):
  return (re.findall('[A-Z][^A-Z]*', text))
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for implementing the split_list function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function needs to split a string at uppercase letters, keeping the uppercase character as the start of each segment
2. **Pattern Identification**: The regex pattern '[A-Z][^A-Z]*' matches:
   - [A-Z]: An uppercase letter (serves as the delimiter)
   - [^A-Z]*: Zero or more characters that are NOT uppercase letters
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Use re.findall() to extract all non-overlapping matches of this pattern
4. **Edge Case Consideration**: The pattern handles:
   - Single uppercase words: "Hello" → ["Hello"]
   - CamelCase strings: "HelloWorld" → ["Hello", "World"]
   - Mixed case strings: "HelloWorldPython" → ["Hello", "World", "Python
