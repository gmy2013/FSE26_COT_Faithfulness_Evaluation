    Calculate the average of even numbers from n down to 2.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound even number (must be positive and even)
    
    Returns:
        float: The average of even numbers from n down to 2
        str: "Invalid Input" if n is not a positive even number
    
    Examples:
        >>> average_Even(6)
        4.0
        >>> average_Even(4)
        3.0
