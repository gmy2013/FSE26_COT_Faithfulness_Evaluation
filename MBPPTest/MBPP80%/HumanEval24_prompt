The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `swap_List` takes a list `newList` as input.
2. It calculates the length of the list and stores it in `size`.
3. It stores the first element of the list in a temporary variable `temp`.
4. It assigns the last element of the list to the first position.
5. It assigns the value stored in `temp` (original first element) to the last position.
6. Finally, it returns the modified list with the first and last el
