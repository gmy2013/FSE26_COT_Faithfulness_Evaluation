Here's the completed function with the corrected docstring:

```python
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
    """
    Calculate the median of two sorted arrays of equal length n.
    
    This function finds the median by merging the two arrays in a single pass
    and tracking the middle two elements needed for median calculation.
    
    Args:
        arr1 (list): First sorted array of length n
        arr2 (list): Second sorted array of length n
        n (int): Length of both arrays
    
    Returns:
        float: The median value of the combined arrays
    """
    i = 0
    j = 0
    m1 = -1
    m2 = -1
    count = 0
    while count < n + 1:
        count += 1
        if i == n:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr2[0]
            break
        elif j == n:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr1[0]
            break
        if arr1[i] <= arr2[j]:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr1[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            m1 = m2
            m2 = arr2[j]
            j += 1
    return (m1 + m2)/2
```

The function efficiently finds the median of two sorted arrays by:
1. Using a single pass through both arrays simultaneously
2. Tracking the two middle elements needed for median calculation
3. Handling edge cases where one array might be exhausted
4. Returning the average of the two middle values as the median

The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1), making it optimal for this problem.
