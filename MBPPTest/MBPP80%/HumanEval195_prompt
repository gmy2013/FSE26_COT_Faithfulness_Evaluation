def return_sum(dict):
  sum = 0
  for i in dict.values():
    sum = sum + i
  return sum
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function takes a dictionary `dict` as input.
2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to accumulate the sum of values.
3. Iterate through each value in the dictionary using `dict.values()`.
4. In each iteration, add the current value to the running total `sum`.
5. After processing all values, return the total sum.
