The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_occurrences` is intended to find the element with the highest frequency in `list1`.
2. Initialize `max_val` to 0 to track the maximum occurrence count.
3. Initialize `result` to the first element of `list1` as a starting candidate.
4. Iterate through each element `i` in `list1`:
   - Calculate the occurrence count of `i` using `list1.count(i)`.
   - If this count exceeds `max_val`, update `max_val` to this count and set `result` to `i`.
5. Return `result`, which is the element with the highest f
