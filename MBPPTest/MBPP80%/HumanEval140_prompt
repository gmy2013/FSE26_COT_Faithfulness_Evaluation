The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `all_Characters_Same` checks if all characters in a string `s` are identical.
2. It first gets the length `n` of the string.
3. If the string is empty (`n=0`), the loop won't run and it returns `True` (correct behavior for empty string).
4. For a non-empty string, it iterates from index 1 to the end.
5. Compares each character with the first character (`s[0]`).
6. If any character differs from the first character, immediately returns `False`.
7. If all characters match the first character, returns `True` after the loop.
8. The implementation correctly handles edge cases (empty stri
