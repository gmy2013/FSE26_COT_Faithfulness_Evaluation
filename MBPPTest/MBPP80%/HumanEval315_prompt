def find_triplet_array(A, arr_size, sum): 
	for i in range( 0, arr_size-2): 
		for j in range(i + 1, arr_size-1): 
			for k in range(j + 1, arr_size): 
				if A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == sum: 
					return  A[i],A[j],A[k] 
					return True
	return False
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze the function step by step:

1. The function has nested loops that iterate through all possible triplets (i, j, k) where i < j < k
2. For each triplet, it checks if the sum equals the target
3. When a valid triplet is found, it returns the three values and then tries to return True
4. However, the second return statement will never execute because the first return exits the function
5. The function should return either the triplet (if found) or False (if not found)

The issue is that after finding a valid triplet, the function tries to return both the triplet and True, but only the first return statement executes.

Here's the corrected approach:
- If a triplet is found, return the triplet
- If no triplet is found after all iterations, return False

The function should be structured t
