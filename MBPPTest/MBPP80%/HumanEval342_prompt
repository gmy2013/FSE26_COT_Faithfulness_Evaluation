from heapq import merge
def combine_lists(num1,num2):
  combine_lists=list(merge(num1, num2))
  return combine_lists
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `combine_lists` takes two lists `num1` and `num2` as input.
2. It uses `heapq.merge` which efficiently merges multiple sorted inputs into a single sorted output.
3. The result of `merge(num1, num2)` is converted to a list and assigned to `combine_lists`.
4. The merged sorted list `combine_lists` is returned.
5. Note: This assumes `num1`
