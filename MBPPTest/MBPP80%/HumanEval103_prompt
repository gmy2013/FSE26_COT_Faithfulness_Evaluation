def harmonic_sum(n):
  if n < 2:
    return 1
  else:
    return 1 / n + (harmonic_sum(n - 1))
The following is chain of thought:
The function `harmonic_sum(n)` computes the sum of the first n terms of the harmonic series (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n) using recursion.

Chain of thought:
1. Base case: When n < 2 (n = 1), return 1 (the first term of the harmonic series)
2. Recursive case: For n â‰¥ 2, return 1/n + harmonic_sum(n-1)
3. This recursively builds the sum from the nth term down to the 1st term
4. The recursion unwinds from n=1 back up to the original n value, accumulating the sum
