Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def div_of_nums(nums, m, n):
    """
    Filter numbers from the list that are divisible by m OR n.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of numbers to filter
        m (int): First divisor
        n (int): Second divisor
    
    Returns:
        list: List of numbers divisible by m or n
    
    Examples:
        >>> div_of_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2, 3)
        [2, 3, 4, 6]
        >>> div_of_nums([10, 15, 20, 25], 5, 10)
        [10, 15, 20, 25]
    """
    result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 or x % n == 0), nums)) 
    return result
```

The function filters the input list `nums` and returns only those numbers that are divisible by either `m` or `n` (or both). The filter object is converted to a list before returning the result.
