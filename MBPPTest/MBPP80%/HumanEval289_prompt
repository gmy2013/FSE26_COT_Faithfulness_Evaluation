The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function finds the index where two arrays first differ, or returns the length if no differences are found in the first n elements.

2. **Input Analysis**: 
   - Takes two arrays (arr1 and arr2) and an integer n
   - n represents the number of elements to compare (likely the length of one array)

3. **Algorithm Selection**: 
   - Uses a linear search approach
   - Iterates through indices 0 to n-1
   - Compares corresponding elements at each index

4. **Comparison Logic**:
   - For each index i from 0 to n-1:
     - If arr1[i] â‰  arr2[i], return the current index i
   - If all n elements match, return n (indicating the extra element is at the end)

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Handles the case where arrays are identical for first n elements by returning n
   - Assumes arr2 has at least n elements (potential for IndexError if not)
