CodeGeneration:
Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def max_sum_list(lists):
    """Return the list with the maximum sum of elements.
    
    Args:
        lists: A list of lists containing numeric values
        
    Returns:
        The sublist with the highest sum of its elements
        
    Examples:
        >>> max_sum_list([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]])
        [10, 11, 12]
        >>> max_sum_list([[1, 2, 3], [100], [4, 5]])
        [100]
        >>> max_sum_list([[-1, -2], [0, -5], [1, 2]])
        [1, 2]
    """
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```

Your chain of thought is correct. The function uses Python's built-in `max()` function with `key=sum` to efficiently find the sublist with the maximum sum by comparing the sums of all sublists rather than the lists themselves.
