CodeGeneration:
The function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete code:

```python
from math import tan, pi

def perimeter_polygon(s, l):
    perimeter = s * l
    return perimeter
```

The function correctly calculates the perimeter of a regular polygon by multiplying the number of sides `s` by the length of each side `l`. The imported `math` functions (`tan` and `pi`) are not used in this particular function but might be needed for other polygon-related calculations in the same module.
