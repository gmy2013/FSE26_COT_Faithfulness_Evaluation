def odd_position(nums):
	return all(nums[i]%2==i%2 for i in range(len(nums)))
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Check if every element at position i has the same parity (odd/even) as its index i.
2. Analyze the return statement: Uses a generator expression with `all()` to verify the condition for all indices.
3. Break down the condition: `nums[i] % 2 == i % 2` compares the parity of the element with the parity of its index.
4. Consider edge cases: Empty list (returns True), single element lists, mixed parity lists.
5. Verify correctness: The condition ensures even indices have even number
