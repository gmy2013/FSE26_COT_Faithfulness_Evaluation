CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it's implementing a greedy approach to find the minimum jumps to reach the end of an array, but there's an issue with the break statement that makes it non-optimal. Let me fix this:

```python
def min_jumps(arr, n):
    """
    Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        Minimum number of jumps to reach arr[n-1] from arr[0], or float('inf') if unreachable
    """
    jumps = [0 for i in range(n)]
    
    if (n == 0) or (arr[0] == 0):
        return float('inf')
    
    jumps[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        jumps[i] = float('inf')
        for j in range(i):
            if (i <= j + arr[j]) and (jumps[j] != float('inf')):
                jumps[i] = min(jumps[i], jumps[j] + 1)
                # Removed the break statement to ensure we check all possible paths
                # The break was causing the algorithm to be greedy but potentially non-optimal
    
    return jumps[n-1]
```

The key change I made was removing the `break` statement. The original implementation was breaking out of the inner loop after finding the first valid jump, which could lead to non-optimal solutions. By removing the break, we ensure that we check all possible paths from previous positions to find the truly minimum number of jumps.

For example, with array `[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`:
- Without break: correctly finds 2 jumps (0→1→4)
- With break: might find a suboptimal path if it breaks early

This implementation now correctly solves the minimum jumps problem using dynamic programming with O(n²) time complexity.
