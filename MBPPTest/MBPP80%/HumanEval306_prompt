def lucky_num(n):
 List=range(-1,n*n+9,2)
 i=2
 while List[i:]:List=sorted(set(List)-set(List[List[i]::List[i]]));i+=1
 return List[1:n+1]
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `lucky_num(n)` aims to generate the first `n` lucky numbers.
2. The initial list `List` is created with `range(-1, n*n+9, 2)`, which generates odd numbers from 1 to approximately nÂ²+7 (since -1 is included and step is 2).
   - Note: The first element is -1, which is not a positive integer, but this might be an offset for indexing.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 2, which will be used as an index to determine the step for filtering.
4. The while loop condition `List[i:]` ensures the loop runs as long as there are elements from index `i` onward.
5. Inside the loop:
   - `List[List[i]::List[i]]` slices the list starting at index `List[i]` with a step of `List[i]`, effectively getting every k-th element where k = `List[i]`.
   - `set(List) - set(...)` removes these elements from the list.
   - The result is converted back to a sorted list and assigned to `List`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
6. After the loop, the function returns `List[1:n+1]`, which excludes the first element (likely the -1) and takes the next `n` elements.
7. This process resembles the sieve for lucky numbers, where we start with odd numbers and repeatedly remove every k-th number where k is the next number in the list.

However, there is a potential issue: the initial list includes -1, which is not a positive integer, and the slicing might be off due to negative indices or incorrect steps. The intended algorithm should generate positive lucky numbers.

Let me correct the implementation to properly generate the first `n` lucky numbers:
