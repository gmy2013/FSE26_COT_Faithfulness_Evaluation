def first_odd(nums):
  first_odd = next((el for el in nums if el%2!=0),-1)
  return first_odd
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for implementing the first_odd function:

1. **Understand the requirement**: The function needs to find the first odd number in a list
2. **Identify odd numbers**: An odd number is any integer where el % 2 != 0
3. **Handle edge cases**: Return -1 if no odd numbers are found in the list
4. **Choose efficient approach**: Use generator expression with next() for early termination
5. **Implement the solution**: 
   - Create generator that yields odd numbers from the input list
   - Use next() to get the first element from the generato
