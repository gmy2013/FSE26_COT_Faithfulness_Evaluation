def check_tuples(test_tuple, K):
  res = all(ele in K for ele in test_tuple)
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `check_tuples` takes two parameters: `test_tuple` and `K`.
2. The goal is to check if all elements in `test_tuple` are present in `K`.
3. Use the `all()` function with a generator expression that iterates over each element `ele` in `test_tuple`.
4. For each element, check if it is in `K` using `ele in K`.
5. Return
