CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function implementation, I can see it's already complete and correctly implements the described functionality. The function:

1. Takes a tuple `test_tup` as input
2. Creates a new tuple `res` containing the first element (`test_tup[0]`) and last element (`test_tup[-1]`)
3. Returns the resulting tuple

The implementation is correct and follows the chain of thought described. Here's the complete function:

```python
def front_and_rear(test_tup):
    res = (test_tup[0], test_tup[-1])
    return (res)
```

This function will work for any non-empty tuple, returning a tuple with the first and last elements. For example:
- `front_and_rear((1, 2, 3, 4))` returns `(1, 4)`
- `front_and_rear(('a', 'b', 'c'))` returns `('a', 'c')`
- `front_and_rear((5,))` returns `(5, 5)` (for a single-element tuple)
