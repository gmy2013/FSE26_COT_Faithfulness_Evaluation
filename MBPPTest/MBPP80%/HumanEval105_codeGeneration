CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it's already complete and correctly implements the subset check using a hash set. The function:

1. Creates a set from `arr1` for O(1) lookups
2. Iterates through `arr2` to check if all elements exist in the set
3. Returns `False` immediately if any element is missing
4. Returns `True` if all elements are found

The implementation is efficient with O(m + n) time complexity and O(m) space complexity. No changes are needed as the function correctly implements the subset check as described in the docstring.

```python
def is_subset(arr1, m, arr2, n):
    hashset = set() 
    for i in range(0, m): 
        hashset.add(arr1[i]) 
    for i in range(0, n): 
        if arr2[i] in hashset: 
            continue
        else: 
            return False
    return True
```
