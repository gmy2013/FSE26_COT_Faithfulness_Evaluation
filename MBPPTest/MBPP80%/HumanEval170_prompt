The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. First, it checks if the length of the expression is odd (using bitwise AND with 1). If so, it returns False immediately because an odd-length expression cannot have balanced pairs.

2. It initializes a deque (used as a stack) to keep track of opening brackets.

3. It iterates through each character in the expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', '['), it pushes it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (')', '}', ']'):
        a. If the stack is empty (meaning there's no matching opening bracket), return False.
        b. Pop the top element from the stack (which should be the most recent unmatched opening bracket).
        c. Check if the popped opening bracket matches the current closing bracket. If not, return False.

4. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty (all opening brackets were matched), return True; otherwise, return False.

The logic is correct for checking balanced parentheses, but there is a syntax error in the condition:
```python
if (top == '(' and ch != ')') or (top == '{' and ch != '}' or (top == '[' and ch != ']')):
```
The parentheses are mismatched. It should be:
```python
if (top == '(' and ch != ')') or (top == '{' and ch != '}') or (top == '[' and ch != ']'):
```
Alternatively, it can be written without the inner parentheses for each condition due to operator precedence (and has higher precedence than or), but the current version has an extra opening parenthesis that causes a syntax error.

Corrected version:
```python
from collections import deque
def check_expression(exp):
    if len(exp) & 1:
        re
