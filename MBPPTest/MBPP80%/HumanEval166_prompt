The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `get_Pairs_Count` takes three parameters: `arr` (list of numbers), `n` (length of the list), and `sum` (target sum).
2. Initialize a counter `count` to 0 to keep track of valid pairs.
3. Use a nested loop structure:
   - Outer loop iterates from index 0 to n-1 (i).
   - Inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1 (j) to avoid duplicate pairs and self-pairs.
4. For each pair (i, j), check if the sum of `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` equals the targe
