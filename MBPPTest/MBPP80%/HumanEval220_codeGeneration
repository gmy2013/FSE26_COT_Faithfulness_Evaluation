However, note that the current implementation with `ChainMap` and an empty dictionary at the front is unnecessary since the empty dictionary doesn't contribute any keys. A simpler and more efficient approach would be to use the dictionary unpacking operator (`**`) available in Python 3.5+, which also handles the precedence correctly (later dictionaries override earlier ones).

Here's an improved version:

```python
def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    """Merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dict1: First dictionary
        dict2: Second dictionary (takes precedence for duplicate keys)
    
    Returns:
        A new dictionary containing the merged key-value pairs
    """
    return {**dict1, **dict2}
```

If you need to maintain compatibility with older Python versions or prefer the original approach, here's the corrected version without the unnecessary empty dictionary:

```python
import collections as ct

def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    """Merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dict1: First dictionary
        dict2: Second dictionary (takes precedence for duplicate keys)
    
    Returns:
        A new dictionary containing the merged key-value pairs
    """
    merged_dict = dict(ct.ChainMap(dict2, dict1))
    return merged_dict
```

Note that in the `ChainMap` version, the order of arguments is reversed compared to the dictionary unpacking approach - `dict2` comes first to give it higher precedence.
