CodeGeneration:
I'll provide the complete function with the docstring based on your chain of thought:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_combinations(test_list):
    """
    Generate all combinations of pairs from the input list and create new tuples
    by adding corresponding elements in reverse order.
    
    Args:
        test_list: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numeric elements
        
    Returns:
        A list of tuples where each tuple is formed by:
        - First element: b1 + a1 (second tuple's first element + first tuple's first element)
        - Second element: b2 + a2 (second tuple's second element + first tuple's second element)
        
    Example:
        >>> find_combinations([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)])
        [(4, 6), (6, 8), (8, 10)]
    """
    res = [(b1 + a1, b2 + a2) for (a1, a2), (b1, b2) in combinations(test_list, 2)]
    return res
```

The function takes a list of 2-element tuples, generates all possible pairs using `combinations`, and for each pair `((a1, a2), (b1, b2))`, it creates a new tuple `(b1 + a1, b2 + a2)` by adding the corresponding elements in reverse order (second tuple's elements first).
