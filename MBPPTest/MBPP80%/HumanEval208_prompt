The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `check_smaller` takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input.
2. The goal is to check if every element in `test_tup1` is greater than the corresponding element in `test_tup2`.
3. Use `zip` to pair elements from both tuples by index.
4. Use a generator expression with `all` to verify that for each pair `(x, y)`, `x > y` holds.
5. Return th
