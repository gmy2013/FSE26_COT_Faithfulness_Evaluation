from itertools import zip_longest, chain, tee
def exchange_elements(lst):
    lst1, lst2 = tee(iter(lst), 2)
    return list(chain.from_iterable(zip_longest(lst[1::2], lst[::2])))
The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. `tee(iter(lst), 2)` creates two independent iterators from the list
2. However, the function doesn't actually use `lst1` and `lst2` from the tee operation
3. Instead, it directly slices the original list `lst`:
   - `lst[1::2]` gets elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5...)
   - `lst[::2]` gets elements at even indices (0, 2, 4...)
4. `zip_longest(lst[1::2], lst[::2])` pairs odd-indexed elements with even-indexed elements
5. If the lists have different lengths, `zip_longest` fills with `None`
6. `chain.from_iterable()` flattens the pairs into a single sequence
7. Finally, `list()` converts the iterator to a list

The function essentially swaps adjacent elements: even-indexed elements become odd-indexed and vice versa.

However, there's an issue: if the list has odd length, the last element (which would be at an even index) gets paired with `None` from `zip_longest`, potentially creating a `None` at the end.

Let me trace an example:
- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- lst[1::2] = [2, 4] (odd indices)
- lst[::2] = [1, 3, 5
