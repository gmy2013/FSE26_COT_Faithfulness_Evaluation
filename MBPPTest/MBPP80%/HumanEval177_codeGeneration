CodeGeneration:
The function you've provided is already complete and correct. Here's the full implementation:

```python
from itertools import groupby

def pack_consecutive_duplicates(list1):
    """Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists.
    
    Args:
        list1: A list of elements that may contain consecutive duplicates
        
    Returns:
        A list where consecutive duplicate elements are grouped into sublists
        
    Examples:
        >>> pack_consecutive_duplicates([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5])
        [[1, 1], [2], [3, 3, 3], [4], [5, 5]]
        
        >>> pack_consecutive_duplicates(['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c'])
        [['a', 'a'], ['b'], ['c', 'c']]
        
        >>> pack_consecutive_duplicates([])
        []
    """
    return [list(group) for key, group in groupby(list1)]
```

The function works exactly as described in your chain of thought:
- It uses `itertools.groupby()` to identify consecutive duplicate elements
- Each group of consecutive duplicates is converted to a list
- The result is a list of these sublists, effectively "packing" consecutive duplicates together

The function handles edge cases like empty lists correctly and works with any data type that supports equality comparison.
