CodeGeneration:
e the two possible products and return the maximum.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def maximum_product(nums):
    """
    Given a list of integers, return the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying any three numbers.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of integers (length >= 3)
    
    Returns:
        int: Maximum product of any three numbers from the list
    
    Examples:
        >>> maximum_product([1, 2, 3])
        6
        >>> maximum_product([-10, -10, 5, 2])
        500
        >>> maximum_product([-1, -2, -3, -4])
        -6
    """
    import heapq
    # Get the three largest numbers and two smallest numbers
    largest_three = heapq.nlargest(3, nums)
    smallest_two = heapq.nsmallest(2, nums)
    
    # Calculate the two possible maximum products
    product1 = largest_three[0] * largest_three[1] * largest_three[2]
    product2 = largest_three[0] * smallest_two[0] * smallest_two[1]
    
    # Return the maximum of the two products
    return max(product1, product2)
