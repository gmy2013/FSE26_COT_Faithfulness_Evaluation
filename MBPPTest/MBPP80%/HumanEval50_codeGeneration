CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and the chain of thought, this implementation correctly checks if all elements of `test_tup2` are present in `test_tup1` (considering `test_tup2` as a set, which removes duplicates).

Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def check_subset(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """Check if all elements of test_tup2 are present in test_tup1.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1: The tuple to check against (the superset)
        test_tup2: The tuple to check (the subset candidate)
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements of test_tup2 are in test_tup1, False otherwise
    """
    res = set(test_tup2).issubset(test_tup1)
    return res
```

The function works correctly by:
1. Converting `test_tup2` to a set to remove duplicate elements
2. Using the `issubset()` method to check if all elements are present in `test_tup1`
3. Returning the boolean result

Note: Since `issubset()` can accept any iterable (not just sets), converting `test_tup1` to a set is not necessary for the method to work.
