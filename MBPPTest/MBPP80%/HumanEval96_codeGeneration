CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function:

```python
def count_even(array_nums):
    """Count the number of even numbers in the given array.
    
    Args:
        array_nums (list): A list of numbers
        
    Returns:
        int: The count of even numbers in the array
    """
    count_even = len(list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) , array_nums)))
    return count_even
```

The function works as follows:
1. `filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0), array_nums)` creates an iterator containing only even numbers
2. `list()` converts the iterator to a list
3. `len()` counts the number of elements in the resulting list
4. The count is returned as the result

Example usage:
```python
print(count_even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 3
print(count_even([2, 4, 6, 8]))        # Output: 4
print(count_even([1, 3, 5, 7]))        # Output: 0
```
