CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function, I notice there's an issue with the current implementation. The function sorts lexicographically first, then by length, but this means the length-based sort will completely override the lexicographical sort since it's done second.

Here's the corrected version that sorts primarily by length and secondarily by lexicographical order:

```python
def sort_sublists(list1):
    """
    Sort a list of sublists primarily by length (number of elements) and 
    secondarily by lexicographical order.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): A list containing sublists to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        list: The sorted list with sublists ordered by length, then lexicographically
    """
    # Sort lexicographically first (secondary sort)
    list1.sort()
    # Then sort by length (primary sort) - this will maintain lex order within same lengths
    list1.sort(key=len)
    return list1
```

However, I should note that this approach actually works correctly because Python's `sort()` is stable when using the `key` parameter. The lexicographical sort is done first, then when sorting by length, sublists of the same length maintain their relative order from the first sort (which was lexicographical).

The function correctly:
1. First establishes lexicographical order within each length group
2. Then groups sublists by length while preserving the lex order within each length group

This results in sublists being sorted primarily by length, and sublists of the same length being sorted lexicographically.
