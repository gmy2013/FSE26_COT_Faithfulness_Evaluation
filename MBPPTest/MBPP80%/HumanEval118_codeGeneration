CodeGeneration:
'a' at all.

However, note that the pattern `'ab*?'` is non-greedy, but since we're only looking for the first occurrence and `re.search` returns as soon as it finds any match, the function effectively just checks if there's at least one 'a' in the text.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import re
def text_match(text):
        patterns = 'ab*?'
        if re.search(patterns,  text):
                return 'Found a match!'
        else:
                return('Not matched!')
```
