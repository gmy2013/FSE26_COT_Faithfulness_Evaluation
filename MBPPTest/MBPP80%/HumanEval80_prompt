def smallest_Divisor(n): 
    if (n % 2 == 0): 
        return 2; 
    i = 3;  
    while (i*i <= n): 
        if (n % i == 0): 
            return i; 
        i += 2; 
    return n; 
The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if n is even: if so, return 2 as the smallest divisor.
2. For odd n, start checking from 3, incrementing by 2 (only odd divisors).
3. Check divisors up to sqrt(n) (i*i <= n) for efficiency.
4. If a divisor is found, return it immedia
