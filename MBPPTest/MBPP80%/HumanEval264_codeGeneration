CodeGeneration:
return a new list where each element is the corresponding element in `nums` multiplied by `n`.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def ntimes_list(nums, n):
    """Return a new list where each element is n times the corresponding element in nums.
    
    Args:
        nums: A list of numbers
        n: A number to multiply each element by
        
    Returns:
        A new list with each element multiplied by n
        
    Examples:
        >>> ntimes_list([1, 2, 3], 2)
        [2, 4, 6]
        >>> ntimes_list([0, -1, 5], 3)
        [0, -3, 15]
    """
    result = map(lambda x: n * x, nums)
    return list(result)
```

The implementation is correct and efficient. The `map` function applies the multiplication operation to each element, and converting it to a list gives us the desired result.
