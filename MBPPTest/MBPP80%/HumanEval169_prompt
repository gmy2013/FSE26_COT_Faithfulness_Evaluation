The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `odd_Num_Sum(n)` calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd numbers.
2. Initialize `j` to 0 (though it will be overwritten in the loop) and `sm` (sum) to 0.
3. Loop `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
4. For each `i`, compute the `i`-th odd number: `j = 2*i - 1`.
5. Raise `j` to the fourth power (by multiplying `j*j*j*j`) and add it to `sm`.
6. After processing all `i`, retu
