The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sum_nums` takes four parameters: `x`, `y`, `m`, and `n`.
2. It calculates the sum of `x` and `y` and stores it in a variable `sum_nums`.
3. It checks if this sum is within the range `[m, n)` (i.e., from `m` inclusive to `n` exclusive).
4. If the sum is in that range, it returns `20`.
5. Otherwise, it returns the actual sum of `x` and `y`.
6. The function handles all numeric types that support addition and comparison.
7. Edge cases: If `m >= n`, the range will be empty, so the co
