import bisect
def right_insertion(a, x):
    i = bisect.bisect_right(a, x)
    return i
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `right_insertion` takes a sorted list `a` and a value `x`.
2. It uses `bisect.bisect_right(a, x)` to find the insertion point for `x` in `a` to maintain sorted order, such that `x` would be inserted after any existing entries of `x`.
3. The function returns this insertion index `i`.
4. This index is the position whe
