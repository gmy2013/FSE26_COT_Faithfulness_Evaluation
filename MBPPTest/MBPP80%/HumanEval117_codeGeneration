CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def alternate_elements(list1):
    """
    Return a new list containing every other element from the input list.
    
    This function extracts elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) from
    the input list and returns them in a new list.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): The input list from which to extract alternate elements
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing every other element from the input list
        
    Examples:
        >>> alternate_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        [1, 3, 5]
        >>> alternate_elements(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
        ['a', 'c']
        >>> alternate_elements([])
        []
    """
    result=[]
    for item in list1[::2]:
        result.append(item)
    return result
```

The function works as described in your chain of thought - it uses list slicing with step 2 to select every other element starting from index 0, then iterates through and appends them to the result list.
