CodeGeneration:
re concise and efficient.

Here's the improved implementation:

```python
def increasing_trend(nums):
    """Check if a list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of numbers to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, False otherwise
    """
    return sorted(nums) == nums
```
