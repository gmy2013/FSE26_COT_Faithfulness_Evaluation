The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the problem and the given function:

The function `pair_OR_Sum` (though named OR, actually computes XOR sum) calculates the sum of XOR values for all unordered pairs in the array.

Given implementation:
- Uses nested loops: O(n²) time complexity
- For each pair (i, j) where i < j, computes arr[i] XOR arr[j] and adds to total

Chain of thought for understanding:
1. Problem: Compute sum of XOR for all unordered pairs in array
2. Current approach: Brute force - check every pair
3. For small n, this works, but for large n (n≈10⁵), O(n²) is too slow
4. Better approach: Use bit manipulation properties
5. Insight: For each bit position k (0 to 31 for integers), count numbers where k-th bit is set
6. Let count_k = number of elements with k-th bit set
7. Then number of pairs where k-th bit contributes to XOR sum is: count_k * (n - count_k)
8. Total contribution for k-th bit: (count_k * (n - count_k)) * (1 << k)
9. Sum over all bits gives total XOR sum

However, since the task is to complete the function (which is already complete but inefficient), and we're asked for structured chain of thought only (not to rewrite), we provide:

Structured chain of thought:
1. Function purpose: Compute sum of XOR for all unordered pairs in array
2. Current implementation: Double nested loops over array indices
3. Time complexity: O(n²) - acceptable for small n, inefficient for large n
4. Space complexity: O(1) - only uses constant extra space
5. C
