The following is chain of thought:
1. Sort list `a` in ascending order to organize elements for pairing.
2. Sort list `b` in ascending order to align with the sorted `a` for minimal absolute differences.
3. Initialize `sum` to 0 to accumulate the total of absolute differences.
4. Iterate `i` from 0 to `n-1` (using `range(n)`) to process each corresponding pair of elements.
5. For each index `i`, compute the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` and add it to `sum`.
6. Ret
