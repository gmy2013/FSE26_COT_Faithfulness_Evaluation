def perimeter_polygon(s,l):
  perimeter = s*l
  return perimeter
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `perimeter_polygon(s, l)` calculates the perimeter of a regular polygon.
2. The perimeter of a regular polygon is given by the formula: number of sides (s) multiplied by the length of each side (l).
3. The provided code correctly implements this formula: `perimeter = s * l`.
4. The function then returns the computed perimeter value.
5. The `math` module is imported but not used in th
