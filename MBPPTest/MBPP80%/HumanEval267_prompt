def length_Of_Last_Word(a): 
    l = 0
    x = a.strip() 
    for i in range(len(x)): 
        if x[i] == " ": 
            l = 0
        else:

The following is chain of thought:
1. Strip leading/trailing whitespace from input string `a` and store in `x`
2. Initialize counter `l` to 0 to track length of current word
3. Iterate through each character in the stripped string `x`:
   - If current character is a space, reset counter `l` to 0 (new word starting)
   - If current character is not a space, increment counter `l` b
