CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, the function appears to be correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def is_abundant(n):
    """
    Check if a number is abundant.
    
    An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors
    (excluding the number itself) is greater than the number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n is abundant, False otherwise
    """
    fctrsum = sum([fctr for fctr in range(1, n) if n % fctr == 0])
    return fctrsum > n
```

The function correctly:
1. Iterates through all numbers from 1 to n-1
2. Checks which numbers are divisors of n (using `n % fctr == 0`)
3. Sums all proper divisors
4. Returns True if the sum exceeds n, indicating an abundant number

This implementation follows the mathematical definition of abundant numbers and should work correctly for positive integers.
