CodeGeneration:
on, which is incorrect for integer comparison. It should use `==` instead.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def find_fixed_point(arr, n):
    """
    Find a fixed point in a given array of distinct integers.
    A fixed point is an index i such that arr[i] == i.
    
    Parameters:
    arr (list): List of distinct integers
    n (int): Length of the array
    
    Returns:
    int: The index of the fixed point if found, -1 otherwise
    """
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == i:  # Changed from 'is' to '=='
            return i
    return -1
```

The key change is replacing `is` with `==` since `is` checks for object identity (same memory location) while `==` checks for value equality, which is what we want for integer comparison.
