CodeGeneration:
Here's the improved function with proper error handling and addressing the identified issues:

```python
from collections import Counter

def second_frequent(input_list):
    """
    Returns the element with the second highest frequency in the input list.
    
    Args:
        input_list: A list of elements to analyze
        
    Returns:
        The element with the second highest frequency, or None if there are
        less than 2 distinct frequencies in the list.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty
    """
    if not input_list:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    
    # Count frequencies using Counter
    freq_counter = Counter(input_list)
    
    # Check if we have at least 2 distinct frequencies
    if len(freq_counter) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Get sorted frequencies in descending order
    sorted_frequencies = sorted(freq_counter.values(), reverse=True)
    
    # Find the second largest frequency
    second_largest_freq = sorted_frequencies[1]
    
    # Find and return the first element with the second largest frequency
    for key, value in freq_counter.items():
        if value == second_largest_freq:
            return key
    
    # This line should never be reached due to the earlier check
    return None
```

Key improvements:
1. Renamed `dict` to `freq_counter` to avoid shadowing built-in type
2. Added input validation for empty lists
3. Added check for minimum 2 distinct frequencies to prevent IndexError
4. Improved variable naming for clarity
5. Added comprehensive docstring
6. Maintained the original behavior of returning the first element found with the second highest frequency
