def sample_nam(sample_names):
  sample_names=list(filter(lambda el:el[0].isupper() and el[1:].islower(),sample_names))
  return len(''.join(sample_names))
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sample_nam` takes a list of strings `sample_names` as input.
2. It filters the list to keep only strings that:

   - Have the remaining characters all lowercase (`el[1:].islower()`)
3. The filtered list is joined into a single string using `''.join(sample_names)`
4. The length of this concatenated string is returned
5. The function effe
