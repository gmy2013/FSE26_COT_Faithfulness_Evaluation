The following is chain of thought:
1. Import the Counter class from collections and the re module for regex operations.
2. Define the function n_common_words with parameters text (input string) and n (number of top words to return).
3. Use re.findall with pattern '\w+' to extract all alphanumeric words from text, handling word boundaries.
4. Create a Counter object from the list of words to count frequencies.
5. Call most_common(n) on the Counter to get the n most frequent words with their counts.
6. Convert the result to a list (though most_common al
