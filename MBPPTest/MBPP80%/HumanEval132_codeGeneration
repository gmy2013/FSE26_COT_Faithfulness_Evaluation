, search the right half by setting `left` to `mid + 1`.
8. After the loop, return `result` which will be the first occurrence index or -1 if not found.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def find_first_occurrence(A, x):
    (left, right) = (0, len(A) - 1)
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if x == A[mid]:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif x < A[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return result
```
