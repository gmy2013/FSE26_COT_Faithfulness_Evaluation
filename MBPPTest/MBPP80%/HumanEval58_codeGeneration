CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and your chain of thought. The function finds duplicate elements in a list, returning each duplicate only once.

```python
def Repeat(x):
    """
    Find all duplicate elements in a list, returning each duplicate only once.
    
    Args:
        x (list): Input list to search for duplicates
        
    Returns:
        list: List containing each duplicate element (appearing only once)
    
    Example:
        >>> Repeat([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4])
        [1, 2, 4]
        >>> Repeat(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b'])
        ['a', 'b']
    """
    _size = len(x) 
    repeated = [] 
    for i in range(_size): 
        k = i + 1
        for j in range(k, _size): 
            if x[i] == x[j] and x[i] not in repeated: 
                repeated.append(x[i]) 
    return repeated
```

The function works as described:
1. It iterates through each element in the list
2. For each element, it checks all subsequent elements for duplicates
3. When a duplicate is found, it adds the element to the result list only if it hasn't been added already
4. Returns the list of unique duplicate elements

This implementation has O(nÂ²) time complexity due to the nested loops, which is efficient enough for small to medium-sized lists. For very large lists, you might consider using a dictionary-based approach for better performance.
