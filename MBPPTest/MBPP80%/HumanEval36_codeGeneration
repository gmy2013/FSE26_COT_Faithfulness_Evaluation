CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and the chain of thought, the implementation appears to be correct and complete. The function properly:

1. Takes two parameters: `actual_cost` and `sale_amount`
2. Compares them for equality using `==` operator
3. Returns `True` when they are equal (no profit, no loss)
4. Returns `False` when they are not equal (either profit or loss)

The code is concise and achieves the intended functionality. No additional changes are needed.

```python
def noprofit_noloss(actual_cost, sale_amount): 
    if sale_amount == actual_cost:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
