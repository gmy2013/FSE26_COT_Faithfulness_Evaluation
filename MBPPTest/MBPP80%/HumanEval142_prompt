def rotate_right(list1,m,n):
  result =  list1[-(m):]+list1[:-(n)]
  return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `rotate_right` takes three parameters: `list1`, `m`, and `n`.
2. The goal is to rotate the list to the right by taking the last `m` elements and placing them at the front, followed by the rest of the list excluding the last `n` elements.
3. The current implementation uses slicing: `list1[-(m):]` gets the last `m` elements, and `list1[:-(n)]` gets all elements except the last `n`.
4. However, note that if `m` and `n` are different, this might not correctly rotate the list as intended (e.g., if `m != n`, the resulting list length may change unexpectedly).
5. For a proper right rotation by `k` positions, we typically do: `list1[-k:] + list1[:-k]`.
6. But here, the function uses two parameters `m` and `n`, which suggests a more general operation. The docstring is missing, so we infer from the code.
7. The current code returns `last m elements` + `all elements except last n`.
8. This might be intended to handle cases where we want to rotate and also remove some elements? Without the docstring, it's ambiguous.
9. However, the user provided the code and asked to complete the function based on the docstring, but the docstring is not provided in the query.
10. The user message only shows the function code and says "Please give the structured chain of thought only!".
11. Since the docstring is missing, we cannot complete the function. We can only analyze the existing code.
12. The existing code returns a list that is the concatenation of the last `m` elements and all elements
