CodeGeneration:
Based on your chain of thought analysis, I can see that the function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
from itertools import groupby

def extract_elements(numbers, n):
    """
    Extract elements from a list that appear exactly n times consecutively.
    
    Args:
        numbers: List of elements (any data type supporting equality comparison)
        n: Integer representing the exact number of consecutive occurrences to filter
    
    Returns:
        List of elements that appear exactly n times consecutively in the input list
    
    Examples:
        >>> extract_elements([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], 2)
        [1, 3]
        >>> extract_elements(['a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c'], 3)
        ['c']
        >>> extract_elements([], 2)
        []
    """
    result = [i for i, j in groupby(numbers) if len(list(j)) == n]
    return result
```

The function correctly:
- Uses `itertools.groupby` to group consecutive identical elements
- Filters for groups with exactly `n` consecutive occurrences
- Returns a list of the elements that meet this criteria
- Handles edge cases like empty lists gracefully
- Works with any data type that supports equality comparison
