The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `mutiple_tuple` takes a tuple `nums` as input.
2. Convert the tuple to a list to make it mutable (though not strictly necessary for iteration).
3. Initialize a variable `product` to 1 to accumulate the product.
4. Iterate through each element `x` in the list (which contains the tuple elements).
5. Multiply each element `x` with the current `product` and update `product`.
6. Return the final product after pro
