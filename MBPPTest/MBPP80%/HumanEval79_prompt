def increasing_trend(nums):
    if (sorted(nums)== nums):
        return True
    else:
        return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `increasing_trend` checks if a list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The current implementation uses `sorted(nums) == nums` to compare the original list with its sorted version.
3. This approach is correct because if the sorted list equals the original, the original must be sorted.
4. However, the function can be simplified by directly returning the boolean result of the comparison.
5. Instead of using an if-else block, we can return `sorted(nums) == nums` directly.
6. This makes the code mo
