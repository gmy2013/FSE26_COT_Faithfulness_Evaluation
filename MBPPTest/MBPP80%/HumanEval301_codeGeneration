CodeGeneration:
Based on your chain of thought, the function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with proper documentation:

```python
from collections import Counter

def add_dict(d1, d2):
    """
    Combine two dictionaries by adding values for common keys.
    
    Args:
        d1 (dict): First dictionary with numeric values
        d2 (dict): Second dictionary with numeric values
    
    Returns:
        Counter: A Counter object containing the combined dictionary where
                 values for common keys are summed and all keys are included.
    
    Example:
        >>> add_dict({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'b': 3, 'c': 4})
        Counter({'b': 5, 'c': 4, 'a': 1})
    """
    add_dict = Counter(d1) + Counter(d2)
    return add_dict
```

The function correctly uses the `Counter` class to perform dictionary addition where values for common keys are summed, and all keys from both dictionaries are included in the result.
