CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis, here's the corrected function:

```python
def remove_tuple(test_list):
    """Remove tuples from test_list where all elements are None.
    
    Args:
        test_list: A list of tuples to filter
        
    Returns:
        A list with tuples that contain at least one non-None element
    """
    res = [sub for sub in test_list if not all(ele == None for ele in sub)]
    return res
```

The key change is returning `res` directly instead of `str(res)`, which preserves the actual list structure rather than converting it to a string representation.
