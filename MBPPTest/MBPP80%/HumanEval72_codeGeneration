CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and chain of thought provided. The function converts a list of digits to a single integer.

```python
def convert(list):
    """
    Converts a list of digits to a single integer.
    
    Args:
        list: A list of integers where each element is a digit (0-9)
        
    Returns:
        int: The integer formed by concatenating all digits in the list
        
    Example:
        >>> convert([1, 2, 3, 4])
        1234
        >>> convert([9, 0, 5])
        905
    """
    s = [str(i) for i in list] 
    res = int("".join(s))  
    return (res)
```

The function works as described in the chain of thought:
1. Takes a list of integers as input
2. Converts each integer to a string
3. Joins all strings together
4. Converts the concatenated string back to an integer
5. Returns the resulting integer

This is useful for converting lists like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` into the integer `1234`.
