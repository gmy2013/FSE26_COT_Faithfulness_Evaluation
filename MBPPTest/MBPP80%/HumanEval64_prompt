def move_last(num_list):
    a = [num_list[0] for i in range(num_list.count(num_list[0]))]
    x = [ i for i in num_list if i != num_list[0]]
    x.extend(a)
    return (x)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `move_last` takes a list `num_list` as input.
2. It creates a list `a` containing the first element of `num_list` repeated as many times as it appears in the list.
3. It creates a list `x` containing all elements from `num_list` that are not equal to the first element.
4. It extends list `x` with the elements from list `a` (all occurrences of the first element).
5. The function returns the modified list `x`, which now has all occurrences of the first element moved to the end.
