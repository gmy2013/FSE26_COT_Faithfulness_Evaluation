CodeGeneration:
Here's the simplified version of the function:

```python
def even_num(x):
    return x % 2 == 0
```

This version directly returns the boolean result of the condition `x % 2 == 0`, which is more concise and Pythonic. When `x` is even, `x % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`, and when `x` is odd, it evaluates to `False`.
