def sum_num(numbers):
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    return total/len(numbers) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function is named `sum_num` and takes a parameter `numbers`.
2. The function initializes a variable `total` to 0.
3. It iterates over each element `x` in `numbers`, adding each element to `total`.
4. After the loop, it returns `total` divided by the length of `numbers`.
5. This calculates the average (mean) of the numbers in the list.
6. The function does not handle empty lists; if `numbers` is empty, `len(numbers)` would
