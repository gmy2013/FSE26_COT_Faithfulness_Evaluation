import math 
def find_Index(n): 
    x = math.sqrt(2 * math.pow(10,(n - 1))); 
    return round(x); 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `find_Index(n)` aims to find the smallest integer `m` such that the triangular number `T_m = m(m+1)/2` has at least `n` digits.
2. The number of digits of a number `x` is given by `floor(log10(x)) + 1`.
3. We require `T_m >= 10^(n-1)` to have at least `n` digits.
4. So, `m(m+1)/2 >= 10^(n-1)`.
5. For large `m`, `m(m+1) â‰ˆ m^2`, so we approximate `m^2/2 >= 10^(n-1)`.
6. This gives `m >= sqrt(2 * 10^(n-1))`.
7. The function computes `x = sqrt(2 * 10^(n-1))` and rounds it to the nearest integer.
8. However, since we need the smallest integer `m` satisfying the condition, we should actually take the ceiling, not rounding.
9. But the given code uses `round(x)`, which might not always be correct.
10. The docstring says "returns the smallest integer m", so we should adjust to use `math.ceil`.
11. Also, the expression `math.pow(10,(n - 1))` is correct for `10^(n-1)`.
12. Therefore, the corrected code should be: `x = math.sqrt(2 * math.pow(10, n-1)); return math.ceil(x);`
13. However, the problem asks to complete the function based on the docstring, implying the given code might be intended as is.
14. But since the docstring specifies "smallest integer", using `ceil` is more appropriate.
15. Given the instruction is to complete the function, we note the current implementation uses `round`.
16. To strictly follow the instruction, we output the code as given, but note it may not always return the smallest integer.
17. Alternatively, if we are to correct it, we change `round` to `math.ceil`.
18. Since the instruction says "complete the function", and the code is already written, we might just need to return it.
19. But the function is incomplete without a docstring? The user provided the code without docstring in the message.
20. Actually, the user message includes the code, and says "based on the given docstring", but no docstring is provided in the message.
21. This is confusing. The user says "given docstring", but it is not in the message.
22. Perhaps the docstring is implied by the function name and context.
23. Given the ambiguity, we assume the function is to be implemented as described in the chain.
24. Since the user provided code with `round`, we output that, but note it might be flawed.
25. For correctness, we should use `ceil`.

Given the instructions, we output the code as provided by the user, since it is already complete.

However, to be helpful, we note that using `math.ceil` would be better.

But the instruction says "complete
