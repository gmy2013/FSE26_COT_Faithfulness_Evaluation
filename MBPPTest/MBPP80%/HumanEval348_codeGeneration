done based on the total number of digits across all elements in each tuple.
7. Finally, convert the sorted list to a string and return it.

Here is the complete code with the docstring:

```python
def count_digs(tup):
    """Return the total number of digits in all elements of the tuple.
    
    Args:
        tup (tuple): A tuple containing numeric elements.
        
    Returns:
        int: The sum of the number of digits in each element when converted to string.
    """
    return sum([len(str(ele)) for ele in tup])

def sort_list(test_list):
    """Sort a list of tuples based on the total number of digits in each tuple.
    
    The list is sorted in ascending order of the total digit count.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): A list of tuples where each tuple contains numeric elements.
        
    Returns:
        str: The string representation of the sorted list.
    """
    test_list.sort(key=count_digs)
    return str(test_list)
