CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the intended lucky number sieve algorithm, here's a corrected implementation:

```python
def lucky_num(n):
    """
    Generate the first n lucky numbers.
    
    Lucky numbers are generated using a sieve process similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes:
    1. Start with all odd numbers
    2. Remove every k-th number where k is the next number in the sequence
    3. Repeat until no more numbers can be removed
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of lucky numbers to return
        
    Returns:
        list: First n lucky numbers
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    
    # Start with all odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, ...)
    # We need enough numbers to find n lucky numbers
    max_size = n * n + 100  # Conservative estimate to ensure we have enough numbers
    numbers = list(range(1, max_size, 2))
    
    i = 1  # Start with index 1 (second element, which is 3)
    
    while i < len(numbers):
        step = numbers[i]
        if step > len(numbers):
            break
            
        # Remove every step-th number starting from position step-1
        # (since list is 0-indexed but we're counting positions)
        to_remove = []
        pos = step - 1
        
        while pos < len(numbers):
            to_remove.append(numbers[pos])
            pos += step
        
        # Remove the numbers and update the list
        numbers = [num for num in numbers if num not in to_remove]
        i += 1
    
    return numbers[:n]
