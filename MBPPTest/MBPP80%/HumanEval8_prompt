def floor_Min(A,B,N):
    x = max(B - 1,N)
    return (A*x) // B
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `floor_Min` takes three integer parameters: A, B, and N.
2. The goal is to compute the floor value of (A*x)/B for an integer x in the range [0, N].
3. The strategy is to choose x to maximize this floor value.
4. The solution sets x to the minimum of (B-1) and N, because:
   - For x >= B, the expression (A*x)//B increases linearly, but the fractional part cycles.
   - The maximum floor value for x in [0, B-1] is achieved at x = B-1.
   - If N < B-1, then x = N is the maximum possible in the allowed range.
5. Therefore, x is set to `min(B-1, N)` to cover both cases.
6. The function returns `(A * x) // B`.

However, the provided code uses `max(B-1, N)` which is incorrect. The correct approach should use `min(B-1, N)`. The provided code has a logical error.

Given the instruction to complete the function based on the docstring (which is not provided here, but implied by the function name and typical problems of this nature), the intended behavior is to compute the maximum floor value of (A*x)/B for x in [0, N]. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def floor_Min(A,B,N):
    x = min(B - 1, N)
    return (A * x) // B
```

But since the instruction says to complete the given function (which has `max`), and the assistant must generate code based on the given docstring (which we don't have), but the user provided the code with `max`, there might be a misunderstanding.

Wait, the user provided the function with `max(B-1, N)`, which is likely a mistake. The typical solution for "Floor Min" problems (like in some programming contests) is to use `min(B-1, N)`.

Given the ambiguity, but following the instruction to "complete the following function based on the given docstring", and since the docstring is not provided, I must assume the provided code is correct as given. However, logically it is wrong.

But the instruction says: "You are a helpful assistant that generates Python code. Complete the following function based on the given docstring."

Since the docstring is not provided in the user's message, I can only rely on the function name and common knowledge.

Common knowledge: In problems like "Floor Min" (e.g., from competitive programming), the goal is to maximize floor(A*x/B) for x in [0,N]. The solution is to set x = min(N, B-1).

Therefore, the provided code with `max` is incorrect.

However, the user might have provided the function with an error, and the assistant should correct it.

But the instruction is to "complete" the function, implying the function might be incomplete, but here it is fully given.

Perhaps the user meant to provide a function stub, but actually provided the full function.

To resolve this, I will assume the provided code has a bug, and the assistant should fix it.

Thus, the correct code is:

```python
def floor_Min(A,B,N):
    x = min(B - 1, N)
    return (A * x) // B
```

But the instruction says "give the structured chain of thought only", so I will not output the code, but the reasoning.
