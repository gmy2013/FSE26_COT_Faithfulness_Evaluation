The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_range_in_list` takes three parameters: `li` (a list), `min` (lower bound), and `max` (upper bound).
2. Initialize a counter `ctr` to 0 to keep track of numbers within the range.
3. Iterate through each element `x` in the list `li`.
4. For each element, check if it lies between `min` and `max` (inclusive).
5. If the condition is true, i
