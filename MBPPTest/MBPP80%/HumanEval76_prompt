def validity_triangle(a,b,c):
 total = a + b + c
 if total == 180:
    return True
 else:
    return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function checks if three angles (a, b, c) form a valid triangle by summing them
2. The triangle angle sum property states that the sum of interior angles must equal 180Â°
3. The function calculates the total sum of the three angles
4. It returns True if the sum equals 180, indicating a valid triangle
5. It returns False if the sum doesn't equal 180, indicating an inv
