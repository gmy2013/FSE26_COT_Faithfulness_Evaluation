CodeGeneration:
The function you've provided is already correct and efficient for checking if any element in a tuple is `None`. Here's the complete code:

```python
def check_none(test_tup):
    """Check if any element in the tuple is None.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): The input tuple to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if any element is None, False otherwise
    """
    res = any(map(lambda ele: ele is None, test_tup))
    return res
```

Alternative implementation (slightly more readable):
```python
def check_none(test_tup):
    """Check if any element in the tuple is None.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): The input tuple to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if any element is None, False otherwise
    """
    return any(ele is None for ele in test_tup)
```

Both implementations work correctly and have the same time complexity (O(n)), but the generator expression version is often considered more Pythonic and readable.
