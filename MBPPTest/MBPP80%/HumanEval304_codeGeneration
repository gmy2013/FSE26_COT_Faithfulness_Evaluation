) and divides by n!.
- This is equivalent to (2n)! / (n! * n!) = C(2n, n).

Based on this analysis, here is the corrected function with proper docstring:

```python
def sum_of_square(n):
    """
    Compute the central binomial coefficient C(2n, n).
    
    This function calculates the binomial coefficient (2n choose n) using the formula:
    C(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! * n!) = product from i=n+1 to 2n of i / n!
    
    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer
        
    Returns:
        int: The central binomial coefficient C(2n, n)
        
    Examples:
        >>> sum_of_square(0)
        1
        >>> sum_of_square(1)
        2
        >>> sum_of_square(2)
        6
        >>> sum_of_square(3)
        20
    """
    return int(factorial(n + 1, 2 * n) / factorial(1, n))
```

Note: The function name `sum_of_square` is misleading since it doesn't actually compute the sum of squares. A more appropriate name would be `central_binomial_coefficient` or `binomial_2n_choose_n`.
