CodeGeneration:
acts as floor) to get the nth polite number.

However, note that the initial `n = n + 1` is actually to adjust for 0-indexing or to start from the first polite number (which is 3). But the docstring expects the nth polite number for a given n (which is 1-indexed). So the function should work as is.

Let me write the code accordingly.

```python
import math

def is_polite(n):
    """
    Return the nth polite number.
    
    Polite numbers are positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
    The nth polite number is given by n + floor(log2(n + log2(n))), but note that the first polite number is 3 (for n=1).
    
    Args:
        n (int): The index of the polite number (starting from 1).
    
    Returns:
        int: The nth polite number.
    
    Examples:
        >>> is_polite(1)
        3
        >>> is_polite(2)
        5
        >>> is_polite(3)
        6
        >>> is_polite(4)
        7
        >>> is_polite(5)
        9
    """
    n = n + 1  # Adjusting because the first polite number is at index 1 but the formula expects n to start from 1?
    # Actually, the formula is derived for n starting from 1. So if we want the first polite number (n=1) we use n=1 in the formula.
    # But in the given code, we are incrementing n by 1. This might be to account for 0-indexed input? However, the docstring says "nth", which is 1-indexed.
    # After checking known values: 
    # For n=1: polite number is 3. With n=1: n + 1 = 2, then compute: 2 + log2(2 + log2(2)) = 2 + log2(2+1)=2+log2(3)≈2+1.58=3.58 -> floor=3. Correct.
    # For n=2: n+1=3, then 3+log2(3+log2(3))≈3+log2(3+1.58)=3+log2(4.58)≈3+2.19=5.19 -> floor=5. Correct.
    # So the increment is necessary to get the correct index.
    
    # Compute the value
    inner_log = math.log(n, 2)
    sum_val = n + inner_log
    outer_log = math.log(sum_val, 2)
    result = n + outer_log
    return int(result)
```

But note: the original code was written in one line. We can also write it concisely.

Final code:

```python
import math

def is_polite(n):
    n = n + 1
    return int(n + math.log(n + math.log(n, 2), 2))
```
