CodeGeneration:
I can see you've identified the issue with the original code. The problem is in the list comprehension where it tries to iterate over a generator directly. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def adjac(ele, sub = []):
    """
    Generate all adjacent coordinates for a given tuple of integers.
    
    For each element in the input tuple, generates coordinates that are
    Â±1 from the original value, creating all possible combinations.
    
    Args:
        ele: Tuple of integers representing coordinates
        sub: Current accumulated coordinate list (used for recursion)
    
    Yields:
        Lists of adjacent coordinates
    """
    if not ele:
        yield sub
    else:
        for j in range(ele[0] - 1, ele[0] + 2):
            yield from adjac(ele[1:], sub + [j])

def get_coordinates(test_tup):
    """
    Get all adjacent coordinates for a given tuple.
    
    Args:
        test_tup: Tuple of integers representing coordinates
        
    Returns:
        List of all adjacent coordinate tuples
    """
    res = list(adjac(test_tup))
    return res
```

The key fix is replacing the problematic list comprehension with a proper `yield from` statement that iterates through the recursive generator calls. This ensures that all coordinate combinations are properly generated and yielded.

Example usage:
```python
