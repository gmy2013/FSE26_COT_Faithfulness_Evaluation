CodeGeneration:
The regex pattern has a typo: `[a-zA-z0-9]$` should be `[a-zA-Z0-9]$` to properly match alphanumeric characters. Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re 
regex = '[a-zA-Z0-9]$'

def check_alphanumeric(string): 
    if(re.search(regex, string)): 
        return ("Accept") 
    else: 
        return ("Discard")
```

The correction changes `A-z` to `A-Z` to properly match uppercase letters from A to Z. The original pattern `A-z` would match characters from ASCII 65 to 122, which includes non-alphabetic characters like `[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, `_`, and `` ` ``.
