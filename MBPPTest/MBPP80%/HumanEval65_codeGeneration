CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis, the function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def count_char(string, char):
    """
    Count the number of occurrences of a character in a string.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The input string to search
        char (str): The character to count
    
    Returns:
        int: The number of times the character appears in the string
    
    Examples:
        >>> count_char("hello", "l")
        2
        >>> count_char("python", "z")
        0
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == char:
            count = count + 1
    return count
```

The function correctly handles:
- All character types including emoji and special characters
- Empty strings
- Characters that don't exist in the string (returns 0)
- Case-sensitive matching
- Multiple occurrences of the same character

The implementation is straightforward and efficient with O(n) time complexity.
