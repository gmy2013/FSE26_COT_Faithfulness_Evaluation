The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the max_sum_of_three_consecutive function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function needs to find the maximum sum of elements where no three consecutive elements are selected. This is a dynamic programming problem.

2. **Base Cases Setup**:
   - For n=1: Only one element, so sum[0] = arr[0]
   - For n=2: Can take both elements, so sum[1] = arr[0] + arr[1]
   - For n=3: Maximum of three possibilities: take first two, take last two, or take first and last (avoiding three consecutive)

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Create sum[] array to store maximum sum up to each index
   - For each position i â‰¥ 3, consider three cases:
     - Don't take current element: sum[i-1]
     - Take current element but skip previous: sum[i-2] + arr[i]
     - Take current and previous elements but skip the one before: arr[i] + arr[i-1] + sum[i-3]

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - sum[i] = max(sum[i-1], sum[i-2] + arr[i], arr[i] + arr[i-1] + sum[i-3])

5. **Edge Handling**:
   - The fun
