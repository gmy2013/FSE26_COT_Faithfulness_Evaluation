def mul_consecutive_nums(nums):
    result = [b*a for a, b in zip(nums[:-1], nums[1:])]
    return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `mul_consecutive_nums` takes a list `nums` as input.
2. The goal is to multiply each consecutive pair of numbers in the list.
3. To access consecutive pairs, we can use `zip` to pair each element with the next one.
4. `nums[:-1]` gives all elements except the last one.
5. `nums[1:]` gives all elements except the first one.
6. Zipping these two lists together creates pairs of (current element, next element).
7. Using a list comprehension, we multiply each pair (a, b) to get
