CodeGeneration:
I notice there's an issue with the function's logic. The docstring says it should compute the arc length given the diameter, but the current implementation returns `None` when the angle is 360 degrees or more, which doesn't make mathematical sense. A full circle (360 degrees) should have a valid arc length equal to the circumference.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def arc_length(d, a):
    """
    Computes the length of a circular arc given the diameter and angle in degrees.
    
    Args:
        d (float): Diameter of the circle
        a (float): Angle in degrees (0 to 360)
    
    Returns:
        float: Length of the arc
    """
    pi = 22/7
    # Calculate arc length: (π * diameter) * (angle / 360)
    arclength = (pi * d) * (a / 360)
    return arclength
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the unnecessary check for angles ≥ 360 degrees
2. Added proper docstring with parameter and return type descriptions
3. The function now correctly handles all valid angles from 0 to 360 degrees
4. For angles greater than 360, it will still calculate the arc length (which represents multiple rotations)

Example usage:
- `arc_length(7, 180)` returns half the circumference (11.0)
- `arc_length(14, 360)` returns the full circumference (44.0)
