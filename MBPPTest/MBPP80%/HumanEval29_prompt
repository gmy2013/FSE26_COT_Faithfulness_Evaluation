def adjac(ele, sub = []):

The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze this code step by step:

1. The `adjac` function is a recursive generator that:
   - Takes an element `ele` (which appears to be a tuple/list of integers) and a `sub` list
   - If `ele` is empty, it yields the current `sub` list
   - Otherwise, it recursively generates coordinates by considering values in the range `[current_element-1, current_element+1]` for each position

2. The `get_coordinates` function:
   - Calls `adjac` with the input tuple `test_tup`
   - Converts the generator to a list and returns it

3. The purpose appears to be: Given a tuple of integers, generate all possible coordinate tuples where each coordinate component can vary by Â±1 from the original value.

4. However, there's an issue: The recursive call `adjac(ele[1:], sub + [j])` returns a generator, but the list comprehension tries to iterate over it directly, which won't work as intended.

5. The correct implementation should use `yield from` with the recursive call, or properly handle the generator output in the list comprehension.

Let me trace through an
