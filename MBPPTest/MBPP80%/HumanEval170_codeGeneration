CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function with the syntax error fixed:

```python
from collections import deque

def check_expression(exp):
    if len(exp) & 1:
        return False
    stack = deque()
    for ch in exp:
        if ch == '(' or ch == '{' or ch == '[':
            stack.append(ch)
        if ch == ')' or ch == '}' or ch == ']':
            if not stack:
                return False
            top = stack.pop()
            if (top == '(' and ch != ')') or (top == '{' and ch != '}') or (top == '[' and ch != ']'):
                return False
    return not stack
```

The key fix was adding the missing closing parenthesis in the condition:
- Changed `(top == '{' and ch != '}' or (top == '[' and ch != ']'))` 
- To: `(top == '{' and ch != '}') or (top == '[' and ch != ']')`

This ensures proper syntax and correct bracket matching logic.
