from collections import Counter
def add_dict(d1,d2):
   add_dict = Counter(d1) + Counter(d2)
   return add_dict
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `add_dict` takes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` as input.
2. The goal is to combine these dictionaries by adding the values of common keys and including all keys.
3. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is ideal for this because it supports addition where values are summed for common keys.
4. Convert both dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to `Counter` objects.
5. Add the two `Counter` objects together: this sums values for keys present in both, and includes keys from both.
6. Return the result, which is a `Counter` objec
