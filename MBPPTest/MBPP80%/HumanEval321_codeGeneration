Here's the completed function with the chain of thought incorporated:

```python
def max_product(arr): 
    """
    Find the pair of numbers in an array that yields the maximum product.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of numbers
        
    Returns:
        tuple: The pair of numbers with maximum product, or None if array has fewer than 2 elements
    """
    arr_len = len(arr) 
    if (arr_len < 2): 
        return None     
    x = arr[0]; y = arr[1]    
    for i in range(0, arr_len): 
        for j in range(i + 1, arr_len): 
            if (arr[i] * arr[j] > x * y): 
                x = arr[i]; y = arr[j] 
    return x, y
```

The function follows the chain of thought:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: Returns `None` if array has fewer than 2 elements
2. **Initialization**: Starts with first two elements as initial maximum product pair
3. **Nested Loop**: Checks all unique pairs (i, j) where j > i
4. **Comparison**: Updates the maximum product pair whenever a better pair is found
5. **Return**: Returns the pair with maximum product as a tuple

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) due to the nested loops, which is optimal for this problem since we need to check all possible pairs.
