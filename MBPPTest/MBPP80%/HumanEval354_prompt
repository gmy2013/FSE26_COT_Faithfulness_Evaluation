def is_abundant(n):
    fctrsum = sum([fctr for fctr in range(1, n) if n % fctr == 0])
    return fctrsum > n
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `is_abundant(n)` checks if a number `n` is abundant.
2. An abundant number is one where the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number.
3. The code calculates `fctrsum` by summing all factors `fctr` in the range from 1 to `n-1` that divide `n` evenly.
4. It returns `True` if `fctrsum > n`, indicating `n` is abu
