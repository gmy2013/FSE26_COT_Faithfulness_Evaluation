def sort_dict_item(test_dict):
  res = {key: test_dict[key] for key in sorted(test_dict.keys(), key = lambda ele: ele[1] * ele[0])}
  return  (res) 

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sort_dict_item` takes a dictionary `test_dict` as input.
2. The goal is to return a new dictionary where the keys are sorted based on a custom sorting criterion.
3. The sorting key for each dictionary key is defined as `lambda ele: ele[1] * ele[0]`.
4. This implies that each key in `test_dict` is expected to be a tuple (or at least an iterable with at least two elements).
5. For each key tuple `(a, b)`, the sorting value is computed as `a * b`.
6. The keys are sorted in ascending order based on this computed value.
7. The dictionary comprehension builds a new dictionary with these sorted keys, preserving their original corresponding values.
8. The sorted dictionary is returned.
