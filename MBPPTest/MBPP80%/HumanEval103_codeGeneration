CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I notice there's an issue with the base case logic. Let me fix it:

```python
def harmonic_sum(n):
    if n < 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 1 / n + harmonic_sum(n - 1)
```

**Explanation of the fix:**
- The original base case `if n < 2: return 1` would incorrectly return 1 for n=0 and negative values
- I added proper handling for n < 1 (return 0 since harmonic sum of 0 terms is 0)
- Made the base case explicit for n == 1
- The recursive case remains the same: 1/n + harmonic_sum(n-1)

**Alternative implementation (iterative version for comparison):**
```python
def harmonic_sum_iterative(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += 1 / i
    return total
```

The recursive version is mathematically elegant but has the limitation of Python's recursion depth for large values of n.
