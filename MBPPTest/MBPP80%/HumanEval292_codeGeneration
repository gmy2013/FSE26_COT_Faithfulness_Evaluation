CodeGeneration:
Based on the function implementation and the chain of thought, here is the complete function with docstring:

```python
def Extract(lst):
    """
    Extract the last element from each item in the input list.
    
    This function takes a list of iterable items (lists, tuples, strings, etc.)
    and returns a new list containing the last element from each item.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): A list of iterable items from which to extract last elements
        
    Returns:
        list: A list containing the last element from each item in the input list
        
    Examples:
        >>> Extract([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])
        [3, 5, 9]
        
        >>> Extract([(1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6,)])
        [2, 5, 6]
        
        >>> Extract(['abc', 'def', 'ghi'])
        ['c', 'f', 'i']
    """
    return [item[-1] for item in lst]
```

The function extracts the last element from each iterable item in the input list using negative indexing (`item[-1]`) and returns them as a new list.
