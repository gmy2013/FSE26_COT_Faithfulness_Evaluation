def Check_Vow(string, vowels): 
    final = [each for each in string if each in vowels] 
    return(len(final)) 

The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Count occurrences of vowels in a string.
2. Analyze the current implementation:
   - Uses list comprehension to filter characters that are in vowels
   - Returns the length of the filtered list (count of vowels)
3. Check for edge cases:
   - Empty string should return 0
   - String with no vowels should return 0
   - Case sensitivity: current implementation is case-sensitive
   - Vowels parameter can be customized
4. Consider improvements:
   - Could make case-insensitive by converting both string and vowels to same case
   - Could add input vali
