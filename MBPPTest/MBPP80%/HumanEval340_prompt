The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_elim` takes a parameter `num`, which is expected to be an iterable (likely a list or tuple).
2. Initialize a counter `count_elim` to 0.
3. Iterate over each element `n` in the input `num`.
4. For each element, check if it is an instance of `tuple`.
5. If an element is a tuple, break out of the loop immediately.
6. If not, increment the counter by 1.
7. After breaking (or finishing the loop), return the counter value.
8. The function counts the number of non-tuple elements from the star
