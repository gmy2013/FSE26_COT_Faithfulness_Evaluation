CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided function and the typical docstring for `find_Index(n)`, which is to find the smallest integer `m` such that the triangular number `T_m = m(m+1)/2` has at least `n` digits, I notice that the current implementation uses `round()` which may not always return the smallest integer satisfying the condition. For correctness, `math.ceil()` should be used instead.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def find_Index(n):
    """
    Find the smallest integer m such that the triangular number T_m = m(m+1)/2 has at least n digits.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The minimum number of digits required.
    
    Returns:
        int: The smallest integer m satisfying the condition.
    """
    x = math.sqrt(2 * math.pow(10, (n - 1)))
    return math.ceil(x)
```

This implementation uses `math.ceil()` to ensure we get the smallest integer `m` that satisfies `m(m+1)/2 â‰¥ 10^(n-1)`, which guarantees the triangular number has at least `n` digits.
