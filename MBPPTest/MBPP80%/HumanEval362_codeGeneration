CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought analysis, the function appears to be complete and correctly implemented. Here's the verified function:

```python
def discriminant_value(x, y, z):
    """
    Calculate the discriminant of a quadratic equation and determine the nature of its solutions.
    
    The discriminant is calculated using the formula: b² - 4ac, where:
    x = a (coefficient of x²)
    y = b (coefficient of x)
    z = c (constant term)
    
    Args:
        x (float): Coefficient of x² term
        y (float): Coefficient of x term
        z (float): Constant term
    
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - string: Description of the solution type
            - float: The calculated discriminant value
    
    Examples:
        >>> discriminant_value(1, -3, 2)
        ('Two solutions', 1.0)
        
        >>> discriminant_value(1, -2, 1)
        ('one solution', 0.0)
        
        >>> discriminant_value(1, 1, 1)
        ('no real solution', -3.0)
    """
    discriminant = (y**2) - (4*x*z)
    if discriminant > 0:
        return ("Two solutions", discriminant)
    elif discriminant == 0:
        return ("one solution", discriminant)
    elif discriminant < 0:
        return ("no real solution", discriminant)
```

The function is well-implemented and handles all three cases of the discriminant value correctly, returning appropriate string descriptions along with the calculated discriminant value.
