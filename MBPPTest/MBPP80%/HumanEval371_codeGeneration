CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and the chain of thought, I can see this is already a complete and correct implementation for concatenating two nested tuples at the top level.

The function correctly:
1. Uses the `+` operator to concatenate the two tuples
2. Returns the result as a new tuple
3. Works with nested tuples since it operates at the top level

Here's the complete function:

```python
def concatenate_nested(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = test_tup1 + test_tup2
  return (res)
```

This implementation is perfect for the given requirement. The `+` operator for tuples creates a new tuple with all elements from the first tuple followed by all elements from the second tuple, which is exactly what's needed for top-level concatenation of nested tuples.
