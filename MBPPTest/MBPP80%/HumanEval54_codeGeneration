CodeGeneration:
*i*i*i*i is equivalent to i⁵, so the code correctly computes the sum of fifth powers.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def fifth_Power_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the fifth powers of all integers from 1 to n.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound of the range (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: The sum of i⁵ for i from 1 to n
    """
    sm = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sm = sm + (i * i * i * i * i)
    return sm
```

The function works as intended - it iterates through numbers 1 to n, calculates each number's fifth power, and accumulates the sum.
