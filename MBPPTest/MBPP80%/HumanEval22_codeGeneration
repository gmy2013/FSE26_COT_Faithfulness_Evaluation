CodeGeneration:
I see you've already provided a complete and correct implementation of the `nth_nums` function! Here's the code with proper formatting:

```python
def nth_nums(nums, n):
    """Raise each number in the list to the nth power.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of numbers
        n: Exponent to raise each number to
        
    Returns:
        List where each element is the corresponding element from nums raised to the nth power
    """
    nth_nums = list(map(lambda x: x ** n, nums))
    return nth_nums
```

Your implementation is perfect - it correctly:
1. Takes a list of numbers and an exponent
2. Uses `map()` with a lambda function to apply the exponentiation
3. Converts the map object to a list
4. Returns the resulting list

The function will work correctly for any list of numbers and any integer exponent.
