def sum_column(list1, C):
    result = sum(row[C] for row in list1)
    return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sum_column` takes two parameters: `list1` (a list of lists) and `C` (an integer index).
2. The goal is to compute the sum of all elements at column index `C` in each row of `list1`.
3. Use a generator expression to iterate over each row in `list1` and extract the element at index `C`.
4. Pass this generator to t
