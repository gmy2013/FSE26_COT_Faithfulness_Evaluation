def find_fixed_point(arr, n): 
	for i in range(n): 
		if arr[i] is i: 
			return i 
	return -1
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `find_fixed_point` takes an array `arr` and its length `n`.
2. It iterates through each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
3. For each index, it checks if the element at that index equals the index itself (`arr[i] == i`).
4. If such a fixed point is found, it returns the index immediately.
5. If no fixed point is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.
6. The implementation uses a linear search approach with O(n) time complexity.
7. Note: The original code uses `is` for comparis
