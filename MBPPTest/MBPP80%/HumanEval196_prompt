The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sum_Odd(n)` computes the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
   - The number of odd terms up to n is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - The sum of the first k odd numbers is kÂ², so `sum1 = terms * terms`.
   - Returns the sum.

2. The function `sum_in_Range(l, r)` computes the sum of all odd numbers in the range [l, r].
   - Uses `sum_Odd(r)` to get the sum of odds from 1 to r.
   - Subtracts `sum_Odd(l - 1)` to r
