CodeGeneration:
l value of `ans` is set to `n - 1`, which represents the worst-case scenario where we need to remove all but one element. This handles cases where no valid contiguous subarray of length > 1 exists.

7. **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n log n) time due to the sorting step and the binary search for each element, making it efficient for typical input sizes.

Now, here's the complete code with improved formatting and comments:

```python
def find_ind(key, i, n, k, arr):
    """
    Helper function to find the largest index j (where j > i) such that
    arr[j] - key <= k using binary search.
    
    Args:
        key: The starting element value (arr[i])
        i: Starting index
        n: Length of array
        k: Maximum allowed difference
        arr: Sorted array
    
    Returns:
        Largest index j where arr[j] - key <= k, or -1 if not found
    """
    ind = -1
    start = i + 1
    end = n - 1
    
    while start <= end:
        mid = start + (end - start) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] - key <= k:
            ind = mid
            start = mid + 1
        else:
            end = mid - 1
    
    return ind


def removals(arr, n, k):
    """
    Find the minimum number of elements to remove such that the difference
    between maximum and minimum in the remaining array is at most k.
    
    Args:
        arr: Input array of integers
        n: Length of the array
        k: Maximum allowed difference
    
    Returns:
        Minimum number of elements to remove
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    ans = n - 1  # Worst case: remove all but one element
    arr.sort()  # Sort the array to enable binary search
    
    for i in range(n):
        j = find_ind(arr[i], i, n, k, arr)
        
        if j != -1:
            # Calculate removals needed for this valid subarray
            removals_needed = n - (j - i + 1)
            ans = min(ans, removals_needed)
    
    return ans
```

Key improvements made:
1. Fixed the binary search logic to properly handle the termination condition
2. Added proper docstrings for both functions
3. Improved code formatting and readability
4. Added comments to explain the logic
5. Fixed the binary search calculation to use integer division
6. Added a check for the base case (n â‰¤ 1)
