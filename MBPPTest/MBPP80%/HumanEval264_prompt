def ntimes_list(nums,n):
    result = map(lambda x:n*x, nums) 
    return list(result)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `ntimes_list` takes two parameters: `nums` (a list of numbers) and `n` (a number).
2. The goal is to multiply each element in `nums` by `n`.
3. The current implementation uses `map` with a lambda function that multiplies each element `x` by `n`.
4. The `map` object is converted to a list and returned.
5. This implementation correctly satisfies the docstring requirement to
