CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, I can see this function calculates the sum of distinct elements in an array. However, I notice there's an issue with the implementation - it doesn't handle the case where the array might be empty (n=0). Let me provide an improved version:

```python
def find_Sum(arr, n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of distinct elements in an array.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): Input array of numbers
        n (int): Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        int/float: Sum of distinct elements in the array
    
    Example:
        >>> find_Sum([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4], 6)
        10
        >>> find_Sum([5, 5, 5], 3)
        5
        >>> find_Sum([], 0)
        0
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    arr.sort()
    total_sum = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            total_sum += arr[i + 1]
    
    return total_sum
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added proper docstring with parameter descriptions and examples
2. Added edge case handling for empty arrays (n=0)
3. Renamed variable `sum` to `total_sum` to avoid shadowing the built-in `sum()` function
4. Maintained the core logic of sorting and comparing adjacent elements to find distinct values

The function still follows the original algorithm: sort the array, then iterate through it while only adding elements that are different from their predecessor.
