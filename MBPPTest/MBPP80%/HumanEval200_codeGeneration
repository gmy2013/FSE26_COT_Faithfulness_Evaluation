CodeGeneration:
1 = 3.

However, note that the docstring is missing in the input. Based on the function name and behavior, it seems to be counting the number of duplicates. Let me provide a corrected version with a proper docstring.

```python
def test_three_equal(x, y, z):
    """
    Count how many values are duplicated among three arguments.
    
    Returns:
        0 if all three values are distinct
        2 if exactly two values are equal (one duplicate)
        3 if all three values are equal (two duplicates)
    """
    result = set([x, y, z])
    if len(result) == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        return 4 - len(result)
```

The function works as follows:
- If all values are unique (set size = 3), returns 0
- If two values are equal (set size = 2), returns 2 (4-2)
- If all values are equal (set size = 1), returns 3 (4-1)

This provides a count of how many values are duplicated rather than just a binary indicator.
