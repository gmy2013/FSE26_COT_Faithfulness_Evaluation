def is_nonagonal(n): 
	return int(n * (7 * n - 5) / 2) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function calculates the nth nonagonal number
2. **Mathematical Formula**: Nonagonal numbers follow the formula: n(7n-5)/2
3. **Input Parameter**: n (position in the sequence)
4. **Calculation Steps**:
   - Multiply n by 7: 7n
   - Subtract 5: 7n - 5
   - Multiply by n: n(7n - 5)
   - Divide by 2: n(7n - 5)/2
5. **Return Type**: Convert result to integer since nonagonal numbers are whole numbers
6. **Edge Cases**: The formula wo
