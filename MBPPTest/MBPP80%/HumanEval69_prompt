def decreasing_trend(nums):
    if (sorted(nums)== nums):
        return True
    else:
        return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `decreasing_trend` should check if the list `nums` is in strictly decreasing order.
2. The current implementation checks if `nums` is equal to `sorted(nums)`, which would be true only for non-decreasing (ascending) order.
3. To check for strictly decreasing order, we should compare `nums` with the reverse of the sorted list in ascending order.
4. Alternatively, we can sort the list in descending order and compare with the original.
5. We can use `sorted(nums, reverse=True)` to get the list in descending order.
6. Then check if `nums` is equal to this sorted descendi
