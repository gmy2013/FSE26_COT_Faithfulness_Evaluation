CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought analysis, here's an optimized version of the function with improved time complexity:

```python
def first_repeated_char(str1):
    """
    Find the first repeated character in a string.
    
    Args:
        str1 (str): Input string to search for repeated characters
        
    Returns:
        str: The first repeated character found, or "None" if no repetitions exist
    """
    seen_chars = set()
    
    for char in str1:
        if char in seen_chars:
            return char
        seen_chars.add(char)
    
    return "None"
```

**Key improvements:**
- Uses a set for O(1) lookups instead of counting through substrings
- Time complexity reduced from O(nÂ²) to O(n)
- Space complexity is O(n) for the set, which is optimal
- Maintains the same functionality and return behavior
- More readable and efficient implementation

The function still:
- Returns the first repeated character encountered
- Returns "None" if no repetitions are found
- Handles edge cases like empty strings correctly
- Processes the string from left to right
