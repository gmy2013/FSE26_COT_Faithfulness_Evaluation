Here is the complete function with detailed comments:

```python
def Sum(N):
    """
    Compute the sum of all distinct prime divisors of N using a sieve-like approach.
    
    Args:
        N (int): The number for which to compute the sum of distinct prime divisors.
        
    Returns:
        int: The sum of all distinct prime divisors of N.
    """
    # Initialize an array to store the sum of distinct prime divisors for each number up to N.
    # For indices 0 and 1, the value remains 0 as they have no prime divisors.
    SumOfPrimeDivisors = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Iterate through all numbers from 2 to N
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        # If SumOfPrimeDivisors[i] is 0, it means i is prime (not processed by any smaller prime)
        if SumOfPrimeDivisors[i] == 0:
            # Mark all multiples of i by adding i to their sum of prime divisors
            j = i
            while j <= N:
                SumOfPrimeDivisors[j] += i
                j += i
                
    return SumOfPrimeDivisors[N]
```

This implementation efficiently computes the sum of distinct prime divisors for N using a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes approach. The time complexity is O(N log log N), which is efficient for reasonably large values of N.
