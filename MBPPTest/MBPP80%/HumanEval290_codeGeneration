CodeGeneration:
e while condition, so we assume non-negative inputs), and compare the lengths of these string representations.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def same_Length(A, B):
    """
    Check if two integers A and B have the same number of digits.

    Args:
        A (int): First integer.
        B (int): Second integer.

    Returns:
        bool: True if A and B have the same number of digits, False otherwise.
    """
    # Convert to strings and get the length (ignoring negative signs if any)
    len_A = len(str(abs(A)))
    len_B = len(str(abs(B)))
    return len_A == len_B
```

This implementation handles positive and negative integers correctly by using `abs()` to get the absolute value before converting to string, ensuring the digit count is accurate regardless of sign.
