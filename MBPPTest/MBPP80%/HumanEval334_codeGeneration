CodeGeneration:
orrect and efficient for this purpose.

However, the initialization to 0 is redundant since it's immediately overwritten. We can remove it for cleaner code.

Here's the improved version:

```python
def series_sum(number):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers.
    
    Args:
        number (int): The number of natural numbers to sum squares of
    
    Returns:
        float: The sum of squares of the first n natural numbers
    """
    return (number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1)) / 6
```

The function now directly returns the result of the mathematical formula without the unnecessary intermediate variable assignment.
