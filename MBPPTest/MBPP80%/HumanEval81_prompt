def mul_list(nums1,nums2):
  result = map(lambda x, y: x * y, nums1, nums2)
  return list(result)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `mul_list` takes two lists `nums1` and `nums2` as parameters.
2. The goal is to multiply corresponding elements from both lists.
3. The solution uses `map` with a `lambda` function that multiplies each pair of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
4. Since `map` returns an iterator, it is converted to a list with `list()`
