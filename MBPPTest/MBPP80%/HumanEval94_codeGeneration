CodeGeneration:
lengths - the function will only compare up to the length of the shorter tuple.

Here's the complete function with proper handling for tuples of different lengths:

```python
def check_greater(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """
    Check if every element in test_tup1 is less than the corresponding element in test_tup2.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1 (tuple): First tuple to compare
        test_tup2 (tuple): Second tuple to compare
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements in test_tup1 are less than corresponding elements in test_tup2,
              False otherwise. If tuples have different lengths, only compares up to the shorter length.
    """
    res = all(x < y for x, y in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
    return res
```

The function will work correctly for:
- Tuples of equal length
- Tuples of different lengths (compares only the common indices)
- Empty tuples (returns True since there are no elements to compare)
- Any data types that support the < comparison operator
