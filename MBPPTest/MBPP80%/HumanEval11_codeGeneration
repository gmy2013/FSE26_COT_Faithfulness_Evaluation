CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought and the provided code, the function appears to be correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def merge(lst):
    """
    Transpose a list of lists (convert rows to columns).
    
    Args:
        lst: A list of lists to be transposed
        
    Returns:
        A new list of lists where the rows and columns are swapped
        
    Example:
        >>> merge([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
        [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
    """
    return [list(ele) for ele in list(zip(*lst))]
```

The function correctly:
1. Takes a 2D list as input
2. Uses `zip(*lst)` to transpose the matrix (swap rows and columns)
3. Converts each tuple from zip to a list
4. Returns the transposed list of lists
