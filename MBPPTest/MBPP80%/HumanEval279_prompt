def Check_Solution(a,b,c) : 
    if ((b*b) - (4*a*c)) > 0 : 
        return ("2 solutions") 
    elif ((b*b) - (4*a*c)) == 0 :

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `Check_Solution` takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the coefficients of a quadratic equation.
2. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is calculated as `(b*b) - (4*a*c)`.
3. If the discriminant is greater than 0, the quadratic equation has two distinct real solutions, so return "2 solutions".
4. If the discriminant is exactly 0, the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution (a repeated root), so return "1 solution".
5. If the discriminant is less than 0, the quadratic equation has no real solutions (only complex ones)
