CodeGeneration:
Here's the corrected function:

```python
def decreasing_trend(nums):
    """
    Check if the list is in strictly decreasing order.
    
    Args:
        nums (list): List of numbers to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if the list is strictly decreasing, False otherwise
    """
    return nums == sorted(nums, reverse=True)
```

The function now:
1. Uses `sorted(nums, reverse=True)` to get the list sorted in descending order
2. Compares the original list with this descending sorted version
3. Returns `True` only if they are identical (meaning the original list was already in strictly decreasing order)
4. Returns `False` otherwise

This correctly identifies strictly decreasing sequences like `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` while rejecting non-decreasing sequences like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` or unordered sequences like `[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
