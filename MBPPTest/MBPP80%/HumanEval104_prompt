def sort_sublists(list1):
      list1.sort()  
      list1.sort(key=len)
      return  list1
The following is chain of thought:
1. First sort the list lexicographically (alphabetically/numerically) to establish baseline order
2. Then sort by length (number of elements in each sublist) to group sublists by size
3. The key=len parameter ensures the second sort uses sublist length as the sorting criterion
4. Return the final sort
