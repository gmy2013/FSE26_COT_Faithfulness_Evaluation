The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `text_uppercase_lowercase` checks if the input string matches a specific pattern.
2. The pattern `'[A-Z]+[a-z]+$'` requires:
   - One or more uppercase letters at the start (`[A-Z]+`)
   - Followed by one or more lowercase letters (`[a-z]+`)
   - And must be at the end of the string (`$`)
3. However, the pattern does not account for the entire string from start to finish (missing `^` anchor).
4. The current pattern would match substrings at the end, which might not be the intended behavior.
5. To match the entire string (from start to end) with uppercase followed by lowercase, the pattern should be `'^[A-Z]+[a-z]+$'`.
6. The function uses `re.search` which searches anywhere in the string, but with `$` it restricts to the end.
7. With the current pattern, "ABCabc" would match, but "abcABC" would not (since uppercase must come first).
8. The function returns 'Found a match!' if the
