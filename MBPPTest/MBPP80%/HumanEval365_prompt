def remove_empty(tuple1): #L = [(), (), ('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d')]
   tuple1 = [t for t in tuple1 if t]
   return tuple1
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_empty` takes a tuple `tuple1` as input.
2. The goal is to remove any empty tuples or tuples containing only empty strings.
3. The provided solution uses a list comprehension to filter the input.
4. The condition `if t` checks for truthiness: 
   - An empty tuple `()` is falsy, so it is removed.
   - A tuple containing only an empty string `('',)` is falsy because the empty string is falsy, so it is removed.
   - Tuples with non-empty elements are truthy and kept.
5. The filtered list is returned (note: it returns a list, not a tuple).
6. The function does not handle nested struct
