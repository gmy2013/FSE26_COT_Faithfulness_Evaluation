CodeGeneration:
d, otherwise `False`.

The function is complete and correct as written. Here's the full function for clarity:

```python
def is_decimal(num):
    import re
    dnumre = re.compile(r"""^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$""")
    result = dnumre.search(num)
    return bool(result)
```

This function will correctly identify strings that represent:
- Whole numbers (e.g., "123", "0")
- Numbers with exactly 1 decimal place (e.g., "123.4")
- Numbers with exactly 2 decimal places (e.g., "123.45")

It will reject:
- Negative numbers
- Numbers with more than 2 decimal places
- Non-numeric strings
- Numbers with other formatting like commas or currency symbols
- Empty strings
- Numbers that start or end with a decimal point
