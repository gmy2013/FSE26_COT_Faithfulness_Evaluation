def tuple_to_set(t):
  s = set(t)
  return (s) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function takes a tuple `t` as input.
2. Convert the tuple to a set using `set(t)` - this removes duplicates and creates an unordered collection.
3. Return the resulting set.
4. The parentheses around `s` in the return statement are redundant but valid syntax
