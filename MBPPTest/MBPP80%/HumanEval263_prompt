def palindrome_lambda(texts):
  result = list(filter(lambda x: (x == "".join(reversed(x))), texts))
  return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Filter a list of strings to return only palindromes.
2. Analyze current implementation:
   - Uses filter() with lambda function to check if string equals its reverse
   - Converts result to list and returns it
3. Identify potential issues:
   - Case sensitivity: "Racecar" would not be detected as palindrome
   - Non-alphanumeric characters: "madam!" would fail
   - Empty strings: "" would be considered a palindrome (which is correct)
4. Consider improvements:
   - Convert to same case for case-insensitive matching
   - Remove non-alphanumeric character
