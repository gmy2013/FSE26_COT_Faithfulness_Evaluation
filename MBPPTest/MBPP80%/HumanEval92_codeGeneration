CodeGeneration:
y), including leading/trailing spaces if present, though those are not specifically trimmed here.

7. **Alternative Approach**: Without regex, one could use string methods like `split()` and `join()`, but regex is efficient and concise for this task.

8. **Potential Improvements**: To also remove leading and trailing spaces, one might chain `.strip()` or adjust the regex, but the current function focuses only on internal multiple spaces.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
import re

def remove_multiple_spaces(text1):
    """
    Replace multiple consecutive spaces in a string with a single space.

    This function uses regular expressions to identify sequences of one or more
    space characters and replaces them with a single space, effectively
    normalizing the spacing within the string.

    Parameters:
    text1 (str): The input string that may contain multiple consecutive spaces.

    Returns:
    str: The string with multiple spaces collapsed into single spaces.

    Examples:
    >>> remove_multiple_spaces("Hello    world!")
    'Hello world!'
    >>> remove_multiple_spaces("Multiple   spaces   here.")
    'Multiple spaces here.'
    >>> remove_multiple_spaces("NoExtraSpaces")
    'NoExtraSpaces'
    """
    return re.sub(' +', ' ', text1)
```
