def rombus_area(p,q):
  area=(p*q)/2
  return area
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function name is `rombus_area`, which suggests it calculates the area of a rhombus.
2. The parameters are `p` and `q`, which are likely the lengths of the two diagonals.
3. The formula for the area of a rhombus is (diagonal1 * diagonal2) / 2.
4. The implementation correctly uses this formula: `(p * q) / 2`.
5. The function returns the computed area.
6. No additional logic or error handling is present in the given code.
7. The impleme
