CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function based on the provided code and docstring:

```python
def get_product(val):
    """Calculate the product of all elements in a list.
    
    Args:
        val (list): List of numeric values
        
    Returns:
        int/float: Product of all elements in the list
    """
    res = 1
    for ele in val:
        res *= ele
    return res

def find_k_product(test_list, K):
    """Find the product of elements at index K across all sublists.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): List of sublists containing numeric values
        K (int): Index position to extract elements from each sublist
        
    Returns:
        int/float: Product of all elements at index K across sublists
        
    Example:
        >>> find_k_product([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 1)
        80  # (2 * 5 * 8 = 80)
    """
    res = get_product([sub[K] for sub in test_list])
    return res
```

The function works as described in your chain of thought:
- Extracts the K-th element from each sublist
- Calculates the product of all these extracted elements
- Returns the final product result
