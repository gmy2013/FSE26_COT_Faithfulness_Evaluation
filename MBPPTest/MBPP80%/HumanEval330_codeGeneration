numbers, since the sum of cubes is equal to the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.

Here is the corrected function with improved variable naming and documentation:

```python
import math

def sum_series(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers.
    
    Uses the mathematical identity: 1³ + 2³ + 3³ + ... + n³ = (n(n+1)/2)²
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number of natural numbers to sum cubes of
    
    Returns:
        float: The sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers
    """
    return math.pow((n * (n + 1)) / 2, 2)
```

The function correctly implements the mathematical formula for the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers, which is indeed equal to the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.
