```python
def check_Even_Parity(x):
    """
    Check if the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of x has even parity.
    
    This function uses Brian Kernighan's algorithm to count the number of set bits
    and returns True if the count is even (even parity), False otherwise.
    
    Note: This function is designed for nonnegative integers. For negative integers,
    the behavior is undefined due to Python's arbitrary precision integer representation.
    
    Args:
        x (int): A nonnegative integer whose parity is to be checked
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if x has even parity (even number of set bits), False otherwise
        
    Examples:
        >>> check_Even_Parity(5)  # 5 in binary is '101' (2 set bits - even)
        True
        >>> check_Even_Parity(7)  # 7 in binary is '111' (3 set bits - odd)
        False
        >>> check_Even_Parity(0)  # 0 has 0 set bits (even)
        True
    """
    parity = 0
    while (x != 0): 
        x = x & (x - 1) 
        parity += 1
    if (parity % 2 == 0): 
        return True
    else: 
        return False
