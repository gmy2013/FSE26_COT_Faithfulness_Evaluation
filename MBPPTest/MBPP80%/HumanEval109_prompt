def front_and_rear(test_tup):
  res = (test_tup[0], test_tup[-1])
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `front_and_rear` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input.
2. We need to return a tuple containing the first element (index 0) and the last element (index -1) of `test_tup`.
3. The solution creates a new tuple `res` by accessing these two elements.
4. The function returns this tuple `res`.
