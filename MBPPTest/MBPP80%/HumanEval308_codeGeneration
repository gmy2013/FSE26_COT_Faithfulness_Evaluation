CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and your chain of thought. Here's the implementation:

```python
def previous_palindrome(num):
    """
    Find the largest palindrome number strictly less than the given number.
    
    Args:
        num (int): A positive integer greater than 1
        
    Returns:
        int: The largest palindrome number less than num, or None if no palindrome exists
        
    Examples:
        >>> previous_palindrome(10)
        9
        >>> previous_palindrome(100)
        99
        >>> previous_palindrome(101)
        99
    """
    for x in range(num-1, 0, -1):
        if str(x) == str(x)[::-1]:
            return x
    return None
```

The function:
1. Takes an integer `num` as input
2. Iterates backwards from `num-1` down to 1
3. Checks each number by converting to string and comparing with its reverse
4. Returns the first palindrome found (largest one less than `num`)
5. Returns `None` if no palindrome is found (though this shouldn't happen for integers > 1)
