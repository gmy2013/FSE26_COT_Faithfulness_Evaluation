def geometric_sum(n):
  if n < 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return 1 / (pow(2, n)) + geometric_sum(n - 1)
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing the given geometric_sum function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function aims to compute the sum of a geometric series with ratio 1/2 from n=0 to the given n.

2. **Base Case Identification**: The base case is when n < 0, which returns 0. This handles negative inputs and terminates the recursion when n decreases below 0.

3. **Recursive Case Analysis**: For n >= 0, the function returns 1/(2^n) + geometric_sum(n-1). This recursively sums the terms of the geometric series.

4. **Mathematical Verification**: The geometric series sum S = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/2^n = 2 - 1/2^n. The function correctly implements this through recursion.

5. **Termination Check**: The recursion decreases n by 1 each call, eventually reaching n < 0, ensuring termination for all finite n.

6. **Edge Case Handling**: The function properly handles n=0 (returns 1) and negative n (returns 0).

7. **Potential Iss
