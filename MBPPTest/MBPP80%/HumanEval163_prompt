The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `number_ctr` counts digits in a string.
2. It initializes a counter `number_ctr` to 0.
3. It iterates through each character in the string using index-based loop.
4. For each character, it checks if it is a digit by comparing to '0' and '9'.
5. If the character is a digit, it increments the counter.
6. Finally, it returns the total
