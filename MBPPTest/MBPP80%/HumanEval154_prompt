The following is chain of thought:
1. **Check for insufficient elements**: If the list has fewer than 2 elements, return `None` immediately since there can't be a second smallest.
2. **Check for two identical elements**: If there are exactly two elements and they are equal, return `None` since there is no distinct second smallest.
3. **Remove duplicates**: Create a set to track duplicates and build a list of unique elements by iterating through the input.
4. **Sort unique elements**: Sort the list of unique elements to order them from smallest to la
