CodeGeneration:
ents to form proper key-value pairs. If the tuple has an odd length, the last element will be ignored since slicing `idx:idx+2` will only yield one element for the last iteration when `idx` is the last index.

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def tuple_to_dict(test_tup):
    """
    Convert a tuple into a dictionary by grouping elements into key-value pairs.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): Input tuple with an even number of elements to form proper pairs.
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary created from consecutive pairs of elements in the tuple.
        
    Example:
        >>> tuple_to_dict(('a', 1, 'b', 2, 'c', 3))
        {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
    """
    res = dict(test_tup[idx : idx + 2] for idx in range(0, len(test_tup), 2))
    return res
```
