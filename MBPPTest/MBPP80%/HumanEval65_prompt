def count_char(string,char):
 count = 0
 for i in range(len(string)):
    if(string[i] == char):
        count = count + 1
 return count
The following is chain of thought:
1. Analyze the function purpose: Count occurrences of a character in a string
2. Review the current implementation:
   - Uses a counter variable initialized to 0
   - Iterates through string indices using range(len(string))
   - Compares each character at position i with the target character
   - Increments counter when match found
   - Returns the final count
3. Verify the logic: The implementation correctly counts character occurrences
4. Consider alternative approaches: Could use string.count() method, but current implementation is valid
5. Confirm edge case handling: Works with em
