The following is chain of thought:
1. Sort both arrival and departure arrays to process events in chronological order.
2. Initialize platform count (plat_needed) and result to 1 (minimum 1 platform needed).
3. Use two pointers: i for arrivals (starting at index 1) and j for departures (starting at index 0).
4. Compare current arrival (arr[i]) with current departure (dep[j]):
   - If arrival <= departure: New train arrives before previous departs → increment platform count.
   - If arrival > departure: Previous train departs before new arrival → decrement platform count.
5. Update maximum platforms needed (result) whenever curr
