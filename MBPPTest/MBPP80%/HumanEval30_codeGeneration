CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the chain of thought, here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def replace_spaces(text):
    """
    Replace all spaces in the given text with underscores.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to process
        
    Returns:
        str: The input string with all spaces replaced by underscores
    """
    return text.replace(" ", "_")
```

The function now properly:
- Takes a string input
- Replaces all spaces with underscores using the `replace()` method
- Returns the modified string
- Has no unreachable code after the return statement
- Includes a proper docstring explaining its purpose and parameters
