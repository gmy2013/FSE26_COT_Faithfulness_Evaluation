The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `lower_ctr` takes a string `str` as input.
2. Initialize a counter variable `lower_ctr` to 0 to keep track of lowercase letters.
3. Iterate through each character in the string using a for loop with index `i`.
4. For each character at position `i`, check if it is a lowercase letter by comparing to 'a' and 'z'.
5. If the character is lowercase, increment the counter `
