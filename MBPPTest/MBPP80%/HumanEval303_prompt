def even_num(x):
  if x%2==0:
     return True
  else:
    return False
The following is chain of thought:

2. The current implementation uses `if x%2==0: return True else: return False`.
3. This can be simplified by directly returning the boolean result of the condition.
4. The simplified version would be: `return x % 2 ==
