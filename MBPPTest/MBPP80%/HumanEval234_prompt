def slope(x1,y1,x2,y2): 
    return (float)(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)  
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `slope` calculates the slope between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
2. The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).
3. The function explicitly casts the result to a float to ensure floating-point division.
4. There is no explicit handling for division by zero (when x2 == x1), which would
