CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the provided docstring and chain of thought. Here's the implementation:

```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    """
    Count the occurrences of each unique sublist in the given list of lists.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): A list containing sublists (can be of any type)
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are tuples representing the original sublists
              and values are integers representing the count of occurrences
    
    Example:
        >>> unique_sublists([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2]])
        {(1, 2): 3, (3, 4): 2}
    """
    result = {}
    for l in list1: 
        result.setdefault(tuple(l), list()).append(1) 
    for a, b in result.items(): 
        result[a] = sum(b)
    return result
```

The function works as described in your chain of thought:
1. It creates a dictionary to store counts
2. Iterates through each sublist, converting it to a tuple (since lists can't be dictionary keys)
3. Uses `setdefault()` to either get existing list or create new one, then appends 1
4. Finally sums up all the 1s to get the total count for each unique sublist
5. Returns the dictionary with tuple keys and integer count values
