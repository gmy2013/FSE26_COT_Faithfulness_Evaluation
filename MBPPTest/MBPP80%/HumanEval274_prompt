  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing and improving the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function aims to find the minimum absolute difference between pairs of numbers in a list of tuples

2. **Current Implementation Review**: 
   - Takes a list `test_list` containing tuples/lists with two elements each
   - Creates a list `temp` of absolute differences between the second and first elements of each tuple
   - Finds the minimum value from these differences
   - Returns the minimum difference

3. **Potential Issues Identified**:
   - Variable naming could be more descriptive (e.g., `temp` â†’ `differences`)
   - Unnecessary parentheses around return value
   - No input validation for edge cases (empty list, non-numeric values)
   - No documentation explaining the expected input format

4. **Edge Case Considerations**:
   - Empty input list should be handled gracefully
   - Non-numeric values in tuples should be validated
   - Single-element lists should be considered

5. **Improved Implementation Plan**:
   - Add input valid
