CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and chain of thought, the function appears to be complete. However, I notice that parameter `b` is not used in the logic, which might be intentional or might indicate an incomplete implementation. 

Here's the function as provided:

```python
def Check_Solution(a,b,c): 
    if (a == c): 
        return ("Yes"); 
    else: 
        return ("No");
```

If this is the intended behavior (only checking if `a` equals `c` and ignoring `b`), then the function is complete. If you'd like me to modify it to incorporate parameter `b` in some way, please provide additional details about the expected logic.
