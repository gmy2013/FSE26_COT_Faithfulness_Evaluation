CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and chain of thought provided. The function groups elements by their second value and returns a dictionary mapping each second value to a list of first values.

```python
from itertools import groupby 

def group_element(test_list):
  """
  Groups elements from a list of tuples by their second element.
  
  Args:
      test_list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains at least two elements.
  
  Returns:
      A dictionary where keys are the second elements from the input tuples,
      and values are lists of the first elements grouped by the second element.
      
  Example:
      >>> group_element([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 1), ('d', 3)])
      {1: ['a', 'c'], 2: ['b'], 3: ['d']}
  """
  res = dict()
  for key, val in groupby(sorted(test_list, key = lambda ele: ele[1]), key = lambda ele: ele[1]):
    res[key] = [ele[0] for ele in val] 
  return (res)
```

The function works as described in the chain of thought:
1. Takes a list of tuples as input
2. Sorts the list by the second element of each tuple
3. Groups the sorted list by the second element
4. Creates a dictionary where each key is a second element value, and the corresponding value is a list of all first elements from tuples that share that second element
5. Returns the resulting dictionary
