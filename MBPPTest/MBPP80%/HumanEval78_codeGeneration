CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis, here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def access_key(dictionary, key):
    """
    Access the value associated with the given key in the dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access
        key: The key to look up in the dictionary
    
    Returns:
        The value associated with the key
    
    Raises:
        KeyError: If the key is not found in the dictionary
    """
    return dictionary[key]
```

If you want to handle missing keys gracefully instead of raising an exception:

```python
def access_key(dictionary, key, default=None):
    """
    Access the value associated with the given key in the dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to access
        key: The key to look up in the dictionary
        default: Default value to return if key is not found (default: None)
    
    Returns:
        The value associated with the key, or default value if key not found
    """
    return dictionary.get(key, default)
```
