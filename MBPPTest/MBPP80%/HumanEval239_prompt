def Check_Solution(a,b,c):  
    if b == 0:  
        return ("Yes")  
    else: 
        return ("No")  
The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the function `Check_Solution(a, b, c)`:

1. The function takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It checks if `b` equals 0.
   - If true, it returns "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it returns "No".
3. The parameters `a` and `c` are not used in the logic.

This suggests the function is intended to verify a condition related to `b` (likely a solution check in an equation where `b` represents a coefficient or similar). The unused parameters `a` and `c` might be placeholders or for potential future use.

Chain of thought:
- The function is named `Check_Solution`, implying it validates a solution.
- The logic solely depends on `b` being zero.
- This could be checking if a linear equation has a solution (e.g., in the context of `a*x + b = c`, if `b` is zero, it might always be solvable? But note: `a` and `c` are unused, so the intent is unclear).
- Alternatively, it might be a stub or incomplete function.

Given the code, the structured chain is:
1. The function checks if `b` is zero.
2. If `b` is zero, it retu
