def find_literals(text, pattern):
    """

    Args:
        text (str): The string to search
        pattern (str): The regex pattern to find
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (pattern_string, start_index, end_index)
    """
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    s = match.start()
    e = match.end()
    return (match.re.pattern, s, e)
