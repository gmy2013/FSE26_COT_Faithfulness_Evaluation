The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `len_log` takes a list of strings `list1` as input.
2. Initialize `min` to the length of the first string in the list.
3. Iterate through each string in `list1`:
   - Compare the length of the current string with `min`.
   - If the current string's length is less than `min`, update `min` to this length.
4. After processing all strings, return the smallest len
