The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `last_Two_Digits(N)` is intended to compute the last two digits of N! (N factorial).
2. The current code has a condition `if (N >= 10): return` which returns `None` for N >= 10. This is incorrect because we need to compute for all N.
3. The condition should be removed to allow computation for all N.
4. The modulus operation `% 100` correctly extracts the last two digits during the factorial calculation.
5. The loop should run from 1 to N (inclusive) to compute the factorial.
6. The initial value of `fac` is 1, which is correct for factorial calculation.
7. The return statement returns `fac`, which holds the last two digits of N!.
8. The corrected funct
