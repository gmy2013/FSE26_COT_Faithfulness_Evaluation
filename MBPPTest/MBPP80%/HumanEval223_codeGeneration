CodeGeneration:
ar the original list and extend it with the odds to modify in-place.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def remove_even(l):
    odds = [x for x in l if x % 2 != 0]
    l.clear()
    l.extend(odds)
    return l
```

This approach:
1. Creates a new list containing only the odd numbers
2. Clears the original list
3. Extends the original list with the odd numbers
4. Returns the modified original list

This maintains the in-place modification behavior while avoiding the iteration issues of the original implementation.
