The following is chain of thought:
1. The function uses Counter to count frequency of elements in input.
2. It sorts the frequency values in descending order.
3. It selects the second largest frequency value (index 1).
4. It iterates through the Counter items to find the key with that frequency.
5. Returns the first key found with the second largest frequency.

However, there are potential issues:
- If there are less than 2 distinct frequencies, index 1 will cause IndexError
- If multiple elements share the second frequency, it returns the first one encountered
- The variable name "dict" shadows the built-in dict type
- The functi
