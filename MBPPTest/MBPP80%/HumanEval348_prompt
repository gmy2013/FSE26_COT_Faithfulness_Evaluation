def count_digs(tup):
  return sum([len(str(ele)) for ele in tup ]) 
def sort_list(test_list):
  test_list.sort(key = count_digs)
  return (str(test_list))
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_digs(tup)` takes a tuple `tup` as input.
2. For each element `ele` in the tuple, convert it to a string and get its length using `len(str(ele))`.
3. Sum all these lengths together and return the total.
4. The function `sort_list(test_list)` takes a list `test_list` as input.
5. Sort the list using the `sort` method with the key `count_digs`, which means each element (which should be a tuple) will be passed to `count_digs` to determine its sort order.
6. The sorting is
