CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, the function appears to be correctly implemented. However, I notice the docstring is missing. Here's the complete function with an appropriate docstring:

```python
import re

def text_starta_endb(text):
    """
    Check if a string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to check
        
    Returns:
        str: 'Found a match!' if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b',
             'Not matched!' otherwise
    """
    patterns = 'a.*?b$'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

The function correctly uses the regex pattern `'a.*?b$'` to:
- Match literal 'a' at the start
- Match any characters (non-greedily) with `.*?`
- Match literal 'b' at the end with `b$`

The `re.search()` function will return a match object if the pattern is found anywhere in the string, and since the pattern includes anchors (implicit start anchor and explicit end anchor `$`), it effectively checks if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'.
