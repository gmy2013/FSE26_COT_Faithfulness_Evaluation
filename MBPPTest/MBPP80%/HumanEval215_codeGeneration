CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and the chain of thought, I notice there's an issue with the implementation. The function creates a local variable `test_tup` but doesn't modify the original tuple (since tuples are immutable). However, the function should return an empty tuple regardless of the input.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def clear_tuple(test_tup):
    """
    Returns an empty tuple regardless of input.
    
    Args:
        test_tup: Any tuple input
        
    Returns:
        tuple: An empty tuple
        
    Example:
        >>> clear_tuple((1, 2, 3))
        ()
        >>> clear_tuple(('a', 'b', 'c'))
        ()
        >>> clear_tuple(())
        ()
    """
    return ()
```

The original implementation was unnecessarily complex. Since we want to return an empty tuple regardless of the input, we can simply return an empty tuple literal `()` directly. This is more efficient and readable than converting to a list, clearing it, and converting back to a tuple.
