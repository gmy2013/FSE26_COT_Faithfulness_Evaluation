CodeGeneration:
is sorted and contains distinct non-negative integers starting from 0, with exactly one missing number in the sequence.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def find_First_Missing(array, start, end):
    """
    Finds the first missing number in a sorted array of distinct non-negative integers.
    
    The array is assumed to be sorted and contain distinct non-negative integers
    starting from 0, with exactly one missing number in the sequence.
    
    Args:
        array: List of distinct non-negative integers (sorted)
        start: Starting index for the search range
        end: Ending index for the search range
        
    Returns:
        int: The first missing number in the sequence
        
    Example:
        >>> find_First_Missing([0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6], 0, 5)
        4
        >>> find_First_Missing([0, 1, 3, 4, 5], 0, 4)
        2
    """
    if (start > end): 
        return end + 1
    if (start != array[start]): 
        return start; 
    mid = int((start + end) / 2) 
    if (array[mid] == mid): 
        return find_First_Missing(array, mid+1, end) 
    return find_First_Missing(array, start, mid)
