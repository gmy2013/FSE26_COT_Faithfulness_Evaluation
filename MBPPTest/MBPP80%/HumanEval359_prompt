def get_noOfways(n):
    if (n == 0):
        return 0;
    if (n == 1):
        return 1; 
    return get_noOfways(n - 1) + get_noOfways(n - 2);
The following is chain of thought:
The function `get_noOfways(n)` appears to implement a recursive Fibonacci sequence calculation, but with base cases that differ from the standard Fibonacci definition.

Chain of thought:
1. The function takes an integer `n` as input
2. Base case: if n == 0, returns 0
3. Base case: if n == 1, returns 1
4. Recursive case: returns sum of function calls with n-1 and n-2
5. This matches the Fibonacci sequence pattern: F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)
6. The function calculates the nth Fibonacci number
7. The name "get_noOfways" suggests it might be intended for counting ways (like climbing stairs), which often follows Fibonacci pattern
8. However, the docstring is missing, so the exact intended purpose is unclear from the code alone
9. The function uses recursion which is inefficient
