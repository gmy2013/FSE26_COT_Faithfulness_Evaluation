CodeGeneration:
I notice you've provided the complete function implementation and a chain of thought. The function appears to be working correctly as written. Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def access_elements(nums, list_index):
    """Access elements from a list at specified indices.
    
    Args:
        nums: A list of elements
        list_index: A list of indices to access from nums
        
    Returns:
        A new list containing elements from nums at the specified indices
        
    Example:
        >>> access_elements([10, 20, 30, 40], [0, 2])
        [10, 30]
        >>> access_elements(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], [1, 3])
        ['b', 'd']
    """
    result = [nums[i] for i in list_index]
    return result
```

Your chain of thought is correct - the function:
1. Takes a list `nums` and a list of indices `list_index`
2. Uses list comprehension to access elements from `nums` at each index in `list_index`
3. Returns the resulting list

The function is complete and functional as written.
