CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function, I notice there's a small issue with the return statement in the else clause - it's using parentheses which is unnecessary. Here's the corrected version:

```python
import re
def text_match_three(text):
    patterns = 'ab{3}?'
    if re.search(patterns, text):
        return 'Found a match!'
    else:
        return 'Not matched!'
```

The function correctly searches for the pattern 'ab{3}?' which matches the literal string "a" followed by exactly three "b" characters. The non-greedy quantifier `?` after `{3}` is redundant since `{3}` specifies an exact count, but it doesn't affect the matching behavior.
