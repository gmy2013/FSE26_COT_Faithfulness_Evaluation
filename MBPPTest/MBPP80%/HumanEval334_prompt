def series_sum(number):
 total = 0
 total = (number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1)) / 6
 return total
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `series_sum` calculates the sum of squares of the first `number` natural numbers.
2. The formula used is: \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \), where \( n \) is the input number.
3. The variable `total` is initialized to 0, then immediately overwritten with the formula result.
4. The formula is mathematically c
