CodeGeneration:
Based on your analysis, the current function only returns even numbers but the name "Split" suggests it should separate both even and odd numbers. Here's an improved implementation that returns both even and odd numbers:

```python
def Split(lst):
    """
    Splits a list of numbers into even and odd numbers.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): A list of numbers to be split
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists - (even_numbers, odd_numbers)
    """
    even_numbers = []
    odd_numbers = []
    
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(num)
        else:
            odd_numbers.append(num)
    
    return (even_numbers, odd_numbers)
```

Alternative implementation using list comprehensions:

```python
def Split(lst):
    """
    Splits a list of numbers into even and odd numbers.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): A list of numbers to be split
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two lists - (even_numbers, odd_numbers)
    """
    even_numbers = [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]
    odd_numbers = [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]
    
    return (even_numbers, odd_numbers)
```

Usage example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
evens, odds = Split(numbers)
print("Even numbers:", evens)  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
print("Odd numbers:", odds)    # [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
