CodeGeneration:
ned.

However, the function name and docstring suggest it should remove "extra" characters, but the current implementation removes all non-word characters (except underscores are also removed due to the inclusion of `_` in the pattern). If the intent is to remove only consecutive duplicates of non-word characters, the pattern should be adjusted. But based on the given code, it seems to remove all non-alphanumeric characters including underscores.

Let me provide a corrected version with a proper docstring:

```python
import re
def remove_extra_char(text1):
    """
    Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string.
    
    This function uses a regular expression to remove any character that is not
    a word character (alphanumeric) or underscore, but note that underscores
    are also removed due to the specific pattern.
    
    Args:
        text1 (str): The input string from which to remove non-alphanumeric characters.
        
    Returns:
        str: The input string with all non-alphanumeric characters removed.
    """
    pattern = re.compile(r'[\W_]+')
    return pattern.sub('', text1)
```

If you meant to remove only consecutive non-alphanumeric characters (treating them as "extra"), the current implementation already does that due to the `+` quantifier. If you have a different requirement, please clarify.
