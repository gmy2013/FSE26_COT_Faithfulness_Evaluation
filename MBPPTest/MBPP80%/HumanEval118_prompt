import re
def text_match(text):
        patterns = 'ab*?'
        if re.search(patterns,  text):
                return 'Found a match!'
        else:
                return('Not matched!')
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `text_match` checks if the input string `text` contains a pattern defined by the regex `'ab*?'`.
2. The regex pattern `'ab*?'` means:
   - `a`: matches the literal character 'a'
   - `b*?`: matches zero or more 'b's, but as few as possible (non-greedy quantifier)
3. This pattern will match:
   - Any occurrence of 'a' (with zero 'b's following it)
   - Or 'a' followed by one or more 'b's (but matching minimally)
4. Since the pattern can match just a single 'a', and `re.search` returns the first match found:
   - The function will return 'Found a match!' if the text contains at least one 'a'
   - It will return 'Not matched!' only if the text contains no
