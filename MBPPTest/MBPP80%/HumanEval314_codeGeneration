CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, the function appears to be working correctly for the described behavior. However, let me verify the logic and provide a complete implementation:

```python
def rearrange_numbs(array_nums):
    """
    Rearranges numbers in a specific order:
    - All zeros come first
    - Then positive numbers in descending order
    - Then negative numbers in ascending order (from least negative to most negative)
    
    Args:
        array_nums (list): List of numbers to be rearranged
        
    Returns:
        list: Rearranged list according to the specified ordering
    """
    result = sorted(array_nums, key=lambda i: 0 if i == 0 else -1 / i)
    return result
```

The function works as described:
- Zeros get key = 0 (highest priority)
- Positive numbers get negative keys: -1/i, so larger positive numbers have keys closer to 0
- Negative numbers get positive keys: -1/i, so less negative numbers have larger positive keys

This results in the ordering: zeros → positive numbers (descending) → negative numbers (ascending).

Example:
```python
print(rearrange_numbs([1, 2, 0, -1, -2, 3, 0]))
