  return length
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `len_complex` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
2. A complex number `cn` is created using `complex(a, b)`.
3. The absolute value (magnitude) of the complex number is computed using `abs(cn)`, which gives the Euclidean length from the origin in the complex plane.
4. This computed length is returned as the result.
5. The function correctly
