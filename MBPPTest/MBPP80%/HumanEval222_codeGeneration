CodeGeneration:
ample` is in the string but not at the beginning), it returns "string doesnt start with the given substring".

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
1. The regex pattern `"\A" + sample` might not work correctly if `sample` contains regex special characters
2. The function name `check_substring` is misleading since it's specifically checking if the string starts with the substring
3. The error message "entered string isnt a substring" is confusing since `sample` is the substring being checked

Here's an improved version:

```python
import re

def check_substring(string, sample):
    """
    Check if a string starts with a given substring.
    
    Args:
        string (str): The main string to search in
        sample (str): The substring to check for at the beginning
    
    Returns:
        str: A message indicating whether the string starts with the substring
             or if the substring is not found at all
    """
    if sample in string:
        # Escape special regex characters in sample
        escaped_sample = re.escape(sample)
        pattern = r"\A" + escaped_sample
        match = re.search(pattern, string)
        if match:
            return "string starts with the given substring"
        else:
            return "string doesn't start with the given substring"
    else:
        return "substring not found in the string"
```
