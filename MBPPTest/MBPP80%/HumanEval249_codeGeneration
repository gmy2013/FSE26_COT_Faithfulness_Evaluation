CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis, here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def is_triangleexists(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if three angles can form a valid triangle.
    
    A valid triangle must satisfy:
    1. All angles are positive (greater than 0)
    2. Sum of angles equals 180°
    3. Each angle is less than 180° (implied by sum condition)
    4. Sum of any two angles is greater than the third angle
    
    Args:
        a, b, c (float): Three angle values in degrees
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if angles can form a valid triangle, False otherwise
    """
    # Check if all angles are positive
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if sum equals 180°
    if abs(a + b + c - 180) > 1e-10:  # Using tolerance for floating point comparison
        return False
    
    # Check triangle inequalities (sum of any two angles > third angle)
    if (a + b > c) and (b + c > a) and (a + c > b):
        return True
    
    return False
```

Key improvements made:
- Added proper docstring with detailed explanation
- Used floating point tolerance for sum comparison
- Changed OR to AND for triangle inequalities
- Made inequalities strict (> instead of >=)
- Added check for positive angles
- Handles edge cases like negative and zero angles
- Uses explicit return statements for clarity
