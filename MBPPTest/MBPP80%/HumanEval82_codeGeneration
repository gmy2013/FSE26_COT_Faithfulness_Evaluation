CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and the chain of thought, this implementation correctly checks if a number can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares. However, there are some optimizations we can make to improve efficiency:

```python
def sum_Square(n):
    """
    Check if a number n can be expressed as the sum of two perfect squares (i² + j² = n).
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if n can be expressed as sum of two squares, False otherwise
    """
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        j = 1
        while j * j <= n - i * i:  # Optimize: j² only needs to go up to n - i²
            if i * i + j * j == n:
                return True
            j += 1
        i += 1
    return False
```

**Key improvements:**
1. **Optimized inner loop condition**: `j * j <= n - i * i` instead of `j * j <= n` - this reduces the search space significantly
2. **Added proper docstring** with parameter and return type documentation
3. **Maintained the same logic** while improving efficiency

The time complexity is still O(n) in the worst case, but the average case performance is much better due to the reduced search space in the inner loop.
