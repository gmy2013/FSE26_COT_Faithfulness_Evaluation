rld', 'Python'].

However, note that the pattern does not handle consecutive uppercase letters correctly (e.g., "HELLO" would be split into ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O']). If you want to split camelCase strings while keeping consecutive uppercase letters together (e.g., "XMLHttpRequest" should become ['XML', 'Http', 'Request']), you might need a different approach.

Here is an improved version that handles consecutive uppercase letters:

```python
import re

def split_upperstring(text):
    """
    Split a camelCase or PascalCase string into words.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to split.
    
    Returns:
        list: A list of words split from the input string.
    
    Examples:
        >>> split_upperstring("HelloWorld")
        ['Hello', 'World']
        >>> split_upperstring("XMLHttpRequest") 
        ['XML', 'Http', 'Request']
        >>> split_upperstring("camelCase")
        ['camel', 'Case']
    """
    return re.findall('[A-Z][a-z]*|[a-z]+', text)
```

This improved pattern `'[A-Z][a-z]*|[a-z]+'` matches either:
- An uppercase letter followed by zero or more lowercase letters, OR
- One or more lowercase letters

This handles both camelCase and PascalCase strings more effectively.
