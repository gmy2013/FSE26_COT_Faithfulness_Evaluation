def is_Product_Even(arr,n): 
    for i in range(0,n): 
        if ((arr[i] & 1) == 0): 
            return True
    return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `is_Product_Even` checks if the product of all elements in the array `arr` (with length `n`) is even.
2. A product is even if at least one factor is even (i.e., divisible by 2).
3. Instead of computing the actual product (which could be large), we can check for the presence of any even number in the array.
4. The code iterates through each element in the array using a loop from index `0` to `n-1`.
5. For each element, it checks if it is even by using the bitwise AND with 1: `(arr[i] & 1) == 0`. This is equivalent to checking if the last bit is 0, which means the number is even.
6. If any even number is found, it returns `True` immediately (early termination)
