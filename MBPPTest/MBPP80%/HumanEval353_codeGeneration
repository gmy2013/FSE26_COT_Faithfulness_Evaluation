CodeGeneration:
else statement.

However, the docstring is missing. Let me provide the complete function with a proper docstring:

```python
def profit_amount(actual_cost, sale_amount):
    """
    Calculate the profit amount when actual cost is greater than sale amount.
    
    Args:
        actual_cost (float): The original cost of the item
        sale_amount (float): The amount the item was sold for
    
    Returns:
        float: The profit amount (actual_cost - sale_amount) if actual_cost > sale_amount
        None: If actual_cost <= sale_amount (no profit or loss situation)
    
    Examples:
        >>> profit_amount(100, 80)
        20.0
        >>> profit_amount(50, 70)
        None
    """
    if actual_cost > sale_amount:
        amount = actual_cost - sale_amount
        return amount
    else:
        return None
```

The function works as intended:
- When actual_cost > sale_amount: returns the profit (difference)
- When actual_cost <= sale_amount: returns None (indicating no profit)
- The docstring provides clear documentation of parameters, return values, and examples
