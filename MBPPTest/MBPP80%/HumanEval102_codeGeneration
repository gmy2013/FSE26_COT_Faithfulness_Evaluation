CodeGeneration:
The function implementation is already correct and complete. Here's the verified code:

```python
def is_key_present(d, x):
    if x in d:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function:
- Takes a dictionary `d` and a key `x` as parameters
- Uses the `in` operator to check if `x` exists as a key in dictionary `d`
- Returns `True` if the key is present, `False` otherwise
- Follows proper Python syntax and dictionary membership checking conventions

The implementation is optimal and doesn't require any modifications.
