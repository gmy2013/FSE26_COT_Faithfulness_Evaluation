def power_base_sum(base, power):
    return sum([int(i) for i in str(pow(base, power))])
The following is chain of thought:
1. Calculate base raised to the given power using pow(base, power)
2. Convert the result to a string to access individual digits
3. Iterate through each character in the string, converting each back to an integer
4. Sum all the integer digi
