Here's the completed function with the docstring:

```python
def maximum_value(test_list):
    """
    Extracts the maximum value from each list in a list of key-list tuples.

    Args:
        test_list (list): A list of tuples where each tuple contains a key and a list of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains the original key and the maximum value from its associated list.

    Examples:
        >>> maximum_value([('a', [1, 2, 3]), ('b', [4, 5, 6])])
        [('a', 3), ('b', 6)]
        >>> maximum_value([('x', [10, 20, 5]), ('y', [8, 12, 15])])
        [('x', 20), ('y', 15)]
    """
    res = [(key, max(lst)) for key, lst in test_list]
    return res
```

The function works as follows:
1. It takes a list of tuples where each tuple contains a key and a list of numbers
2. Uses list comprehension to iterate through each tuple
3. For each tuple, it unpacks the key and list
4. Applies the `max()` function to find the maximum value in each list
5. Returns a new list of tuples with the original keys and their corresponding maximum values
