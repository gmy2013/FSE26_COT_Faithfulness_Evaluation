def max_sum_list(lists):
 return max(lists, key=sum)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_sum_list` takes a list of lists as input.
2. It needs to return the sublist with the maximum sum of its elements.
3. The `max` function can take a `key` parameter to specify how to compare elements.
4. Using `key=sum` tells `max` to compute the sum of each sublist and compare those sums.
5. The sublist with the highest sum wil
