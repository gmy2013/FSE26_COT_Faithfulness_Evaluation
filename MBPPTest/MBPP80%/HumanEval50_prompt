def check_subset(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = set(test_tup2).issubset(test_tup1)
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `check_subset` takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input.
2. Convert `test_tup2` to a set to remove duplicates and enable set operations.
3. Use the `issubset` method to check if all elements of `test_tup2` (as a set) are present in `test_tup1`.
4. Return the boolean result of the subset check.
