CodeGeneration:
Looking at the docstring and the chain of thought, I can see that the function aims to remove duplicate sublists by normalizing them (removing duplicates within each sublist, sorting, and converting to tuples), then using a set to eliminate duplicates.

Here's the improved implementation:

```python
def remove_similar_row(test_list):
    """
    Removes duplicate sublists from the input list by normalizing each sublist.
    
    For each sublist in the input list:
    1. Removes duplicate elements within the sublist
    2. Sorts the remaining elements
    3. Converts to a tuple (for hashability)
    
    Returns a set of these normalized tuples, effectively removing duplicate sublists.
    
    Args:
        test_list: List of lists (sublists can contain any hashable elements)
        
    Returns:
        set: Set of unique normalized tuples representing the distinct sublists
    """
    result = set()
    for sub in test_list:
        # Remove duplicates within sublist, sort, and convert to tuple
        normalized = tuple(sorted(set(sub)))
        result.add(normalized)
    return result
```

This implementation:
1. Iterates through each sublist in `test_list`
2. For each sublist: converts to set (removes duplicates), sorts, converts to tuple
3. Adds each normalized tuple to a set (automatically handles deduplication)
4. Returns the set of unique normalized sublists

The function handles any hashable elements in the sublists and efficiently removes both duplicate sublists and sublists that would be identical after removing duplicates and sorting.
