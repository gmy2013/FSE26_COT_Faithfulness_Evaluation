CodeGeneration:
on assumes that all keys are tuples (or similar) with at least two elements that can be multiplied. If this assumption is violated, it may raise an error.

Here's the complete function with improved formatting and error handling:

```python
def sort_dict_item(test_dict):
    """
    Sort dictionary items by a custom key function.
    
    The function sorts the dictionary keys based on the product of the first two
    elements of each key (assuming keys are tuples or sequences with at least
    two numeric elements).
    
    Args:
        test_dict (dict): A dictionary where keys are expected to be tuples/sequences
                         with at least two numeric elements.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A new dictionary with keys sorted by (key[0] * key[1])
    
    Example:
        >>> sort_dict_item({(2, 3): 'a', (1, 4): 'b', (3, 2): 'c'})
        {(1, 4): 'b', (2, 3): 'a', (3, 2): 'c'}
    """
    try:
        res = {key: test_dict[key] for key in sorted(test_dict.keys(), 
                                                    key=lambda ele: ele[1] * ele[0])}
        return res
    except (IndexError, TypeError) as e:
        raise ValueError("Dictionary keys must be sequences with at least two numeric elements") from e
```
