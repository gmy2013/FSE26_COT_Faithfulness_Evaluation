CodeGeneration:
re `x` can be inserted in list `a` while keeping it sorted, with `x` placed after any existing values equal to `x`.

The function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete function:

```python
import bisect

def right_insertion(a, x):
    """Return the index at which x should be inserted into list a, assuming a is sorted.

    The return value i is such that all e in a[:i] have e <= x, and all e in a[i:] have e > x.
    So if x already appears in the list, a.insert(i, x) will insert just after the rightmost x already there.

    Args:
        a: A sorted list
        x: The value to find the insertion point for

    Returns:
        The insertion index i
    """
    i = bisect.bisect_right(a, x)
    return i
```

The function works as intended - it finds the rightmost position where `x` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of the list.
