The following is chain of thought:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `lcm(x, y)` calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers `x` and `y`.
2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Determine the larger of the two numbers to start the search for LCM from that value (since LCM is at least as large as the larger number).
   - If `x` is greater than `y`, set `z` to `x`; otherwise, set `z` to `y`.
3. **Loop to Find LCM**:
   - Enter an infinite loop (`while True`).
   - Check if `z` is divisible by both `x` and `y` (i.e., `z % x == 0` and `z % y == 0`).
   - If true, assign `lcm = z` and break out of the loop.
   - If not, increment `z` by 1 and continue the loop.
4. **Return Result**: After breaking the loop,
