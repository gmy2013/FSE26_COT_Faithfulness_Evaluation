def check_greater(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = all(x < y for x, y in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. Understand the function purpose: Check if every element in test_tup1 is less than the corresponding element in test_tup2.
2. Identify the approach: Use zip to pair elements from both tuples, then check if all pairs satisfy x < y.
3. Implement the logic: Use a generator expression with all() to verify the condition for each pair.
4. Return the result: The boolean result from the all() function.
5. Consider edge cases: Tuples of different
