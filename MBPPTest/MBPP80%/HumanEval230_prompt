The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_Pairs` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input.
2. Initialize a counter `cnt` to 0 to keep track of the number of pairs.
3. Use a nested loop structure:
   - Outer loop iterates from index `i = 0` to `n-1`.
   - Inner loop iterates from index `j = i+1` to `n-1` to avoid duplicate pairs and self-comparison.
4. For each pair (i, j), check if `arr[i]` equals `arr[j]`.
5. If they are equal, increment the counter `cnt` by 1.
6. After processi
