The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for analyzing and improving the given function:

1. **Identify the function's purpose**: Calculate the average of even numbers from n down to 2

2. **Analyze existing issues**:
   - The function has a return statement followed by another return statement on the same condition, which is unreachable
   - The function uses integer division which may not give precise results for averages
   - The function handles only positive even numbers as valid input

3. **Consider edge cases**:
   - n = 0 (should be handled as invalid input since there are no even numbers to average)
   - n = 2 (smallest valid even number)
   - Negative even numbers (current implementation doesn't handle them)

4. **Determine optimal approach**:
   - Use mathematical formula for sum of even numbers: n(n+2)/4
   - Count of even numbers: n/2
   - Average = (n+2)/2

5. **Implement improvements**:
   - Remove unreachable return statement
   - Handle n=0 case
   - Use mathematical formula for efficiency
   - Return float for precise av
