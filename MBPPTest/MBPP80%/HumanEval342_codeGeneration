Here is the complete function with improved variable naming and a docstring:

```python
from heapq import merge

def combine_lists(list1, list2):
    """
    Combine two sorted lists into a single sorted list using heapq.merge.
    
    Args:
        list1 (list): First sorted list of numbers
        list2 (list): Second sorted list of numbers
    
    Returns:
        list: Combined sorted list containing all elements from both input lists
    
    Example:
        >>> combine_lists([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    """
    combined_list = list(merge(list1, list2))
    return combined_list
```
