The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the function purpose**: The function takes three lists and returns elements that are equal at the same index in all three lists.
2. **Analyze the current implementation**: 
   - Uses `zip` to iterate through corresponding elements of l1, l2, and l3 simultaneously.
   - Checks if all three elements (m, n, o) are equal using `m == n == o`.
   - Appends the matching element to the result list.
3. **Verify correctness**: 
   - The implementation correctly handles the requirement by comparing elements at each index.
   - Returns a list of common elements preserving their original order.
4. **Edge cases consideration**: 
   - Handles lists of different lengths (zip stops
