The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_Rotation` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input.
2. It iterates through the array starting from index 1 to n-1.
3. For each element at index `i`, it compares with the previous element at index `i-1`.
4. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, it returns the current index `i`.
5. This index `i` represents the number of rotations, as the array is sorted and rotated, and the drop indicates the rotation point.
6. If no such drop is found after checking all elements, it returns 0, meaning the array is either not rota
