def sorted_models(models):
 sorted_models = sorted(models, key = lambda x: x['color'])
 return sorted_models
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sorted_models` takes a list of dictionaries `models` as input.
2. Each dictionary in `models` represents a model and has a key 'color'.
3. The goal is to sort the list of dictionaries based on the value of the 'color' key.
4. Use Python's built-in `sorted` function with a `key` parameter.
5. The `key` should be a lambda fun
