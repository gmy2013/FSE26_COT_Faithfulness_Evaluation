import re
def text_match(text):
  patterns = 'a.*?b$'
  if re.search(patterns,  text):
    return ('Found a match!')
  else:
    return ('Not matched!')
The following is chain of thought:
1. Analyze the function purpose: The function checks if the input text matches the pattern 'a.*?b$'
2. Understand the regex pattern: 
   - 'a' matches literal character 'a'
   - '.*?' matches any characters (non-greedy) between 'a' and 'b'
   - 'b$' matches literal 'b' at the end of the string
3. Evaluate the implementation:
   - Uses re.search() which searches for pattern anywhere in the string
   - The '$' anchor ensures 'b' must be at the end
   - Returns appropriate match status messages
4. Confirm the pattern logic: The regex will match strings that start with 'a' and end with 'b', with any content in between
5. Verify the return s
