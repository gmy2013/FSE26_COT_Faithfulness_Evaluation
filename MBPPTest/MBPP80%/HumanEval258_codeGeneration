CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and your chain of thought. Here's the implementation:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def sub_lists(my_list):
    """
    Generate all possible sublists of the input list.
    
    Args:
        my_list (list): Input list for which to generate all sublists
        
    Returns:
        list: List containing all possible sublists of the input list,
              including the empty list and the original list itself
    """
    subs = []
    for i in range(0, len(my_list)+1):
        temp = [list(x) for x in combinations(my_list, i)]
        if len(temp)>0:
            subs.extend(temp)
    return subs
```

This function:
1. Takes any list as input
2. Uses `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible combinations of different lengths
3. Returns a list containing all possible sublists, including:
   - The empty list (when i=0)
   - All single-element sublists
   - All possible combinations of elements
   - The original list itself (when i=len(my_list))

For example:
```python
print(sub_lists([1, 2, 3]))
