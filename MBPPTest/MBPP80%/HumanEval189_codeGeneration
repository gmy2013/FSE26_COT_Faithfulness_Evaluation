CodeGeneration:
Based on your analysis, the function `even_position` is already correctly implemented. The function checks whether every element at position `i` has the same parity (even or odd) as its index `i`, which is exactly what the docstring describes.

Here's the complete function with an appropriate docstring:

```python
def even_position(nums):
    """
    Check if every element at index i has the same parity (even/odd) as its index i.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of integers to check
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if for every index i, nums[i] and i have the same parity,
              False otherwise
              
    Examples:
        >>> even_position([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        True
        >>> even_position([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
        False
        >>> even_position([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5])
        True
    """
    return all(nums[i] % 2 == i % 2 for i in range(len(nums)))
```

The implementation is efficient with O(n) time complexity and O(1) additional space complexity, using a generator expression that evaluates each condition lazily.
