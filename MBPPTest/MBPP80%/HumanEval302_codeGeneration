Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def count_Unset_Bits(n):
    """
    Count the total number of unset bits (0s) in the binary representations
    of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
    
    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound of the range (1 to n)
    
    Returns:
        int: Total count of unset bits in all numbers from 1 to n
    
    Example:
        >>> count_Unset_Bits(3)
        2
        # Binary representations: 1 (1), 2 (10), 3 (11)
        # Unset bits: 0 + 1 + 0 = 2
    """
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        temp = i
        while temp:
            if temp % 2 == 0:
                cnt += 1
            temp = temp // 2
    return cnt
```
