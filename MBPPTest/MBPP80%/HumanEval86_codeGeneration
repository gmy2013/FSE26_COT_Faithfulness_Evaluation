ontinues until one of the base cases is reached, ensuring the function terminates properly.

The function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor using recursion.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def recur_gcd(a, b):
    low = min(a, b)
    high = max(a, b)
    if low == 0:
        return high
    elif low == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return recur_gcd(low, high % low)
```
