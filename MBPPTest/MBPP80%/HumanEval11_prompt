def merge(lst):  
    return [list(ele) for ele in list(zip(*lst))] 
The following is chain of thought:

3. Using `zip(*lst)` unpacks the list and zips corresponding elements from each sublist.
4. Each zipped element is a tuple, which is converted to a list with `list(ele)`.
5. The list comprehension creates a new list of t
