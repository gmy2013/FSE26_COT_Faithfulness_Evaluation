CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the chain of thought, I notice the function should return a tuple but currently returns a list. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def remove_empty(tuple1):
    """
    Remove empty tuples and tuples containing only empty strings from the input tuple.
    
    Args:
        tuple1: A tuple containing various tuples, some of which may be empty or contain empty strings
        
    Returns:
        A tuple with empty tuples and tuples containing only empty strings removed
        
    Example:
        >>> remove_empty(((), (), ('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d')))
        (('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d'))
    """
    return tuple(t for t in tuple1 if t and any(t))
```

The key improvements:
1. Added proper docstring with parameter description, return description, and example
2. Changed the return to convert the filtered result back to a tuple
3. Added `any(t)` to ensure we only keep tuples that contain at least one truthy element
4. This handles the case where a tuple contains only empty strings like `('',)`
