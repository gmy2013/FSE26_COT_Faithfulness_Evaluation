from itertools import groupby 
def extract_elements(numbers, n):
    result = [i for i, j in groupby(numbers) if len(list(j)) == n] 
    return result
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function extracts elements from a list that appear exactly `n` times consecutively.

2. **Library Import**: The `groupby` function from `itertools` is imported to group consecutive identical elements.

3. **Grouping Logic**: 
   - `groupby(numbers)` groups consecutive identical elements together
   - For each group, `i` represents the element value and `j` is the group iterator
   - `len(list(j))` converts the group iterator to a list and gets its length
   - The condition `if len(list(j)) == n` filters for groups with exactly `n` consecutive occurrences

4. **List Comprehension**: Creates a list containing elements `i` where the group length equals `n`

5. **Return Value**: Returns the filtered list of elements that meet the consecutive occurrence criteria

6. **Edge Case Consideration**: 
   - Handles empty input lists gracefully (returns empty list)
   - Works with any data type that supports equality comparison
   - Only counts consecutive occurrences, not total occur
