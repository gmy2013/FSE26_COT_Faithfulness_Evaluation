Here's the complete function based on the docstring and your chain of thought:

```python
def count_Pairs(arr, n):
    """
    Count the number of pairs of equal elements in the array.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of elements
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of pairs where arr[i] == arr[j] and i < j
    """
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[j]:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

The function counts all pairs of indices (i, j) where i < j and arr[i] equals arr[j], using a nested loop approach to avoid duplicate counting.
