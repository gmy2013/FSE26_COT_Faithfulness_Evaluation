CodeGeneration:
The function you provided is already correct and efficient. Here's the complete implementation with the docstring:

```python
def odd_position(nums):
    """Check if all elements in the list are at positions matching their parity.
    
    For each index i, the element nums[i] should have the same parity as i:
    - Even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) should contain even numbers
    - Odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) should contain odd numbers
    
    Args:
        nums: A list of integers
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if all elements match their position's parity, False otherwise
        
    Examples:
        >>> odd_position([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5])
        True
        >>> odd_position([2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 5])
        False
        >>> odd_position([])
        True
    """
    return all(nums[i] % 2 == i % 2 for i in range(len(nums)))
```

The function correctly handles:
- Empty lists (returns True)
- Single element lists (index 0 requires an even number)
- All edge cases by comparing each element's parity with its index parity
- Uses efficient generator expression with `all()` for short-circuit evaluation
