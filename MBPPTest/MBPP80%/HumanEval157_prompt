    for l in  list1:

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of sublists (`list1`) as input.
2. Initialize an empty dictionary `result` to store counts of unique sublists.
3. Iterate over each sublist `l` in `list1`:
   - Convert the sublist `l` to a tuple (since lists are unhashable and cannot be dictionary keys).
   - Use `setdefault` to initialize the key (tuple) with an empty list if it doesn't exist, then append 1 to that list.
   - This creates a dictionary where each key is a unique sublist (as tuple) and the value is a list of 1's (one for each occurrence).
4. After processing all sublists, iterate over the dictionary items:
   - For each key-value pair, replace the list of
