def zip_list(list1,list2):  
 result = list(map(list.__add__, list1, list2)) 
 return result
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `zip_list` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as arguments.
2. The goal is to combine corresponding elements from both lists into sublists.
3. The current implementation uses `map` with `list.__add__` to add corresponding elements.
4. However, `list.__add__` concatenates lists, so if `list1` and `list2` contain lists, this will work.
5. But if `list1` and `list2` contain non-list elements, using `list.__add__` will cause an error.
6. The docstring is missing, but based on the function name and implementation, it seems intended to work like `zip` but returning lists of pairs.
7. Actually, the current implementation requires `list1` and `list2` to be lists of lists, and it concatenates corresponding inner lists.
8. To make it more general and match typical `zip` behavior (but returning lists instead of tuples), we should use a list comprehension with `zip`.
9. Revised approach: iterate through `zip(list1, list2)` and create a list for each pair.
10. This will work for any iterables and elements, not just lists of lists.
11. The corrected function should be: `return [list(pair) for pair in zip(list1, list2)]`
12. Alternatively, if the
