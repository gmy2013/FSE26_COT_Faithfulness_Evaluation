CodeGeneration:
I notice that the docstring for the `rotate_right` function is missing from your query. Without the docstring, I cannot complete the function based on its intended specification.

However, I can analyze the existing code:

```python
def rotate_right(list1,m,n):
  result =  list1[-(m):]+list1[:-(n)]
  return result
```

This function currently:
1. Takes the last `m` elements of `list1` using `list1[-(m):]`
2. Takes all elements except the last `n` elements using `list1[:-(n)]`
3. Concatenates these two slices and returns the result

The behavior depends on the relationship between `m` and `n`:
- If `m = n`, this performs a standard right rotation by `m` positions
- If `m â‰  n`, the resulting list length will be different from the original

Please provide the docstring so I can complete the function according to its intended specification.
