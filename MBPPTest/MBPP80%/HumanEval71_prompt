The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_of_three` takes three parameters: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
2. The function compares the three numbers to find the maximum value.
3. First, it checks if `num1` is greater than or equal to both `num2` and `num3`.
   - If true, it assigns `num1` to `lnum`.
4. If the first condition is false, it checks if `num2` is greater than or equal to both `num1` and `num3`.
   - If true, it assigns `num2` to `lnum`.
5. If both previous conditions are false, it defaults to
