The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_char` takes a string `str1` as input.
2. It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string.
3. The `Counter` object `temp` stores characters as keys and their counts as values.
4. The `max` function is used with `key=temp.get` to find the character with the maximum frequency.
5. If multiple characters have the same maximum frequency, `max` returns the
