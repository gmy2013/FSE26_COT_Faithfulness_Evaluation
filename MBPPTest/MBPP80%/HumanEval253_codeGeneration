CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, the function appears to be correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with proper documentation:

```python
import heapq as hq

def raw_heap(rawheap):
    """
    Transform the input list into a min-heap in-place using heapq.heapify.
    
    Args:
        rawheap (list): The input list to be converted into a min-heap
        
    Returns:
        list: The heapified list (same list object, modified in-place)
        
    Note:
        This function modifies the original input list in-place.
    """
    hq.heapify(rawheap)
    return rawheap
```

The function correctly:
1. Takes a list as input
2. Uses `heapq.heapify()` to convert it to a min-heap in-place
3. Returns the modified list
4. The original input list is altered as expected with in-place heapification
