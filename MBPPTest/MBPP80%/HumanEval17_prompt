def div_list(nums1,nums2):
  result = map(lambda x, y: x / y, nums1, nums2)
  return list(result)
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `div_list` takes two lists `nums1` and `nums2` as arguments.
2. The goal is to perform element-wise division between corresponding elements of `nums1` and `nums2`.
3. The `map` function is used with a `lambda` that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns `x / y`.
4. The `map` object is converted to a list and returned.
5. Note: This
