CodeGeneration:
ast added ugly number, append it to `uglies`.
6. Return the last element of `uglies`.

However, there's a potential issue with this implementation: `heapq.merge` requires that the input iterables are already sorted, which they are in this case since `gen` yields in the order of `uglies` (which is maintained as sorted). But as `uglies` grows, the generators are re-used and continue to yield new products. This approach should work correctly.

Let me complete the code with the missing part:

```python
import heapq

def nth_super_ugly_number(n, primes):
    uglies = [1]
    def gen(prime):
        for ugly in uglies:
            yield ugly * prime
    merged = heapq.merge(*map(gen, primes))
    while len(uglies) < n:
        ugly = next(merged)
        if ugly != uglies[-1]:
            uglies.append(ugly)
    return uglies[-1]
```

The implementation is complete and should correctly find the nth super ugly number. The key insight is using a heap to efficiently merge the streams of products from each prime, ensuring we always get the next smallest candidate.
