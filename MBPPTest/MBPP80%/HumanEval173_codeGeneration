CodeGeneration:
turn "Invalid Email"

Here's the complete function with improved formatting:

```python
import re

regex = '^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w{2,3}$'

def check_email(email):
    """Check if an email address is valid based on regex pattern.
    
    Args:
        email (str): The email address to validate
        
    Returns:
        str: "Valid Email" if valid, "Invalid Email" otherwise
    """
    if re.search(regex, email):
        return "Valid Email"
    else:
        return "Invalid Email"
```

Note: This regex pattern has some limitations:
- It only accepts lowercase letters
- It requires the TLD to be exactly 2-3 characters
- It doesn't support newer TLDs that can be longer
- It doesn't handle internationalized domain names

For production use, consider using a more comprehensive email validation library or a more robust regex pattern.
