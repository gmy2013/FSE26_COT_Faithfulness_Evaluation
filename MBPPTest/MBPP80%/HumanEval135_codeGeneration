CodeGeneration:
The function is already complete and correct. Here's the full implementation:

```python
import bisect

def left_insertion(a, x):
    i = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
    return i
```

This function:
- Takes a sorted list `a` and a value `x`
- Uses `bisect.bisect_left()` to find the leftmost position where `x` can be inserted while maintaining sorted order
- Returns the insertion index `i`

The function works as specified and requires no additional code.
