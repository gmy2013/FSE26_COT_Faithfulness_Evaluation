CodeGeneration:
of even numbers up to n is floor(n/2)
   - The sum of even numbers from l to r can be calculated as:
        sum_even(r) - sum_even(l-1)
   - Where sum_even(n) = k*(k+1) where k = n//2

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def sum_Natural(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of natural numbers to sum
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of first n natural numbers
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

def sum_Even(l, r):
    """
    Calculate the sum of even numbers between l and r (inclusive).
    
    Args:
        l (int): Lower bound (inclusive)
        r (int): Upper bound (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        int: Sum of even numbers in range [l, r]
    """
    def sum_even_up_to(n):
        """Helper function to calculate sum of even numbers up to n"""
        k = n // 2
        return k * (k + 1)
    
    return sum_even_up_to(r) - sum_even_up_to(l - 1)
```
