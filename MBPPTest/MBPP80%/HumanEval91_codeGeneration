CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, here's the corrected function:

```python
def last_Two_Digits(N): 
    fac = 1
    for i in range(1, N + 1): 
        fac = (fac * i) % 100
    return fac
```

The key changes made:
1. Removed the incorrect condition `if (N >= 10): return` that was preventing computation for N â‰¥ 10
2. The function now correctly computes the last two digits of N! for all values of N
3. Maintained the efficient approach of using modulus 100 during the multiplication to prevent integer overflow and directly compute the last two digits
