The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `product_Equal(n)` checks if the product of digits at odd positions equals the product of digits at even positions in number `n`.
2. For numbers less than 10 (single-digit), it returns `False` since there are no two positions to compare.
3. Initialize `prodOdd` and `prodEven` to 1 to accumulate products for odd and even positions respectively.
4. Process digits from right to left (least significant digit first) using modulo and integer division.
5. In each iteration:
   - Extract the rightmost digit (odd position) and multiply it with `prodOdd`.
   - Remove that digit by integer division.
   - Check if `n` becomes 0 to avoid processing further.
   - Extract the next rightmost digit (even position) and multiply
