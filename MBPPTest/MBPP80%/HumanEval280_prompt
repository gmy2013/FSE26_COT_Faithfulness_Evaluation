The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for analyzing this function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function `sum_even_odd` takes a list `list1` and returns the sum of the first even and first odd numbers found in the list.

2. **First Even Extraction**: 
   - Uses a generator expression `(el for el in list1 if el%2==0)` to iterate through elements and find those that are even (divisible by 2)
   - `next()` gets the first element from this generator
   - If no even number exists, returns the default value `-1`

3. **First Odd Extraction**:
   - Uses a generator expression `(el for el in list1 if el%2!=0)` to find odd numbers (not divisible by 2)
   - `next()` gets the first element from this generator
   - If no odd number exists, returns the default value `-1`

4. **Return Value**: Returns the sum of the first even number found and the first odd number found
   - If either doesn't exist, uses `-1` as the missing value
   - If both don't exist, returns `-2` (-1 + -1)

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty list: Both generators return `-1`, sum is `-2`
   - List with only evens: First odd returns `-1`
   - List with onl
