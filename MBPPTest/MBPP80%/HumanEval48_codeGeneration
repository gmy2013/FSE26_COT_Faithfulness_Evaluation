CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it's already complete and correctly implements the described functionality. The function:

1. Takes a list `nums` and two indices `m` (start) and `n` (end)
2. Initializes a sum variable to 0
3. Iterates through the range from `m` to `n` (inclusive) using `range(m, n+1, 1)`
4. Adds each element at the current index to the sum
5. Returns the total sum

The function is well-implemented and handles the inclusive range correctly. Here's the complete code as provided:

```python
def sum_Range_list(nums, m, n):
    sum_range = 0
    for i in range(m, n+1, 1):
        sum_range += nums[i]
    return sum_range
```

This function will successfully calculate the sum of elements from index `m` to index `n` (inclusive) in the given list `nums`.
