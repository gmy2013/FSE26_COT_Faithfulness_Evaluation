The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_duplic` takes a list `lists` as input.
2. It initializes two empty lists: `element` to store unique elements and `frequency` to store their consecutive frequencies.
3. If the input list is empty, it returns the empty `element` list immediately.
4. It initializes `running_count` to 1 to start counting the first element.
5. It iterates through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element.
6. For each element, it checks if it is equal to the next element.
   - If yes, it increments `running_count`.
   - If no, it appends the current `running_count` to `frequency` and the current element to `element`, then resets `running_count` to 1.
7. After the loop, it ap
