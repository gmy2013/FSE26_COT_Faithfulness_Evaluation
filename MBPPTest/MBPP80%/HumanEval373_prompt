The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the min_sum_path function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: This function solves the minimum path sum problem in a triangular array using dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach

2. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a memoization array of the same length as the input array A
   - Store the bottom row values directly into the memo array since they represent the base case

3. **Bottom-up Processing**:
   - Iterate from the second-to-last row up to the top row
   - For each element in the current row, calculate the minimum path sum by adding the current element's value to the minimum of the two adjacent elements from the row below

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - After processing all rows, the top element of the memo array contains the minimum path sum from top to bottom
   - Return memo[
