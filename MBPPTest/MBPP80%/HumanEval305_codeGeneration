CodeGeneration:
h tuple contains the captured groups (year, month, day) for each match found in the URL.

However, the function could be improved to handle cases where no date is found and to return a more structured result. Here's an enhanced version:

```python
import re

def extract_date(url):
    """
    Extract date components from a URL string.
    
    Args:
        url (str): The URL string to search for date patterns
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains (year, month, day) strings,
              or an empty list if no dates are found
    """
    pattern = r'/(\d{4})/(\d{1,2})/(\d{1,2})/'
    return re.findall(pattern, url)
