CodeGeneration:
ling:** The array is binary (0s and 1s). The precomputation starts from the end (n-1) and moves backwards, correctly accumulating zeros. The loop for counting swaps iterates from left to right, adding zeros to the right for each 1.

Here is the complete function with detailed comments:

```python
def find_Min_Swaps(arr, n):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to group all 1's together in a binary array.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of integers (0s and 1s) representing the binary array.
        n (int): The length of the array.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to group all 1's together.

    Explanation:
        The function works by precomputing the number of zeros to the right of each index.
        For each '1' in the array, the number of swaps required to move it to the end of the group of 1's
        is equal to the number of zeros to its right (each zero requires one swap to pass).
        Summing these values for all '1's gives the total minimum adjacent swaps.
    """
    # Precompute noOfZeroes: noOfZeroes[i] stores the number of zeros from index i to the end (inclusive)
    noOfZeroes = [0] * n
    # Initialize the last element: if the last element is 0, count 1; else 0.
    noOfZeroes[n - 1] = 1 - arr[n - 1]
    # Traverse from the second last element to the first (right to left)
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        # Carry over the count from the next index
        noOfZeroes[i] = noOfZeroes[i + 1]
        # If current element is 0, increment the count
        if arr[i] == 0:
            noOfZeroes[i] += 1

    count = 0
    # Traverse from left to right
    for i in range(0, n):
        # For each '1', add the number of zeros to its right (which are the zeros it must swap with to move right)
        if arr[i] == 1:
            count += noOfZeroes[i]

    return count
```
