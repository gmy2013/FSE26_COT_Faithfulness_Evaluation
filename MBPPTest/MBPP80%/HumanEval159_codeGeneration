CodeGeneration:
er `n` is not used in the function, but it's included in the signature, likely for consistency with other functions or as a requirement from the problem context.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def unique_Element(arr,n):
    s = set(arr)
    if (len(s) == 1):
        return ('YES')
    else:
        return ('NO')
```
