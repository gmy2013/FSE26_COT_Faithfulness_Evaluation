def move_zero(num_list):

    x = [ i for i in num_list if i != 0]
    x.extend(a)
    return (x)
The following is chain of thought:
1. Count zeros: Use `count(0)` to determine how many zeros are in `num_list`.
2. Create zero list: Generate a list `a` containing that many zeros.
3. Filter non-zero elements: Create list `x` with all elements from `num_list` that are not zero.
4. Append zeros: Use `extend` to add the zeros from `a` to the end of `
