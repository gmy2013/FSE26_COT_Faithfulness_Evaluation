CodeGeneration:
1's with the sum of that list (i.e., the count of occurrences).
5. Return the dictionary with unique sublists (as tuples) as keys and their counts as values.

However, the code can be simplified by directly counting occurrences without storing lists of 1's. Here is an optimized version:

```python
def unique_sublists(list1):
    """
    Count the occurrences of each unique sublist in the given list of lists.

    Args:
        list1 (list of list): A list containing sublists.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are tuples (representing unique sublists) and values are their counts.

    Example:
        >>> unique_sublists([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2]])
        {(1, 2): 3, (3, 4): 2}
    """
    result = {}
    for sublist in list1:
        key = tuple(sublist)
        result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + 1
    return result
```

This version is more efficient and readable. It uses `dict.get()` to either retrieve the current count or default to 0, then increments it by 1 for each occurrence.
