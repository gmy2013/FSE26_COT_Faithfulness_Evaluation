Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def lcm(x, y):
    """
    Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers x and y.
    
    Args:
        x (int): First integer
        y (int): Second integer
        
    Returns:
        int: The least common multiple of x and y
        
    Example:
        >>> lcm(4, 6)
        12
        >>> lcm(15, 20)
        60
    """
    if x > y:
        z = x
    else:
        z = y
    while(True):
        if((z % x == 0) and (z % y == 0)):
            lcm = z
            break
        z += 1
    return lcm
```

The function works as follows:
1. It starts by finding the larger of the two numbers since the LCM must be at least that large
2. It then enters an infinite loop that increments the candidate value `z`
3. For each value of `z`, it checks if it's divisible by both input numbers
4. Once a common multiple is found, it breaks the loop and returns the result
5. The docstring provides clear documentation of the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and usage examples
