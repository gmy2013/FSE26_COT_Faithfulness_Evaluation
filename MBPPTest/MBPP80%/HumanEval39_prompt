The following is chain of thought:

2. It iterates over each `item` in the list.
3. For each string `item`, it uses `re.sub` with the regex pattern `r" ?\([^)]+\)"` to:

4. It replaces all such matches with an empty string `""`, effectively removing parenthetical content and any preceding space.

6. To fix this, we should collect t
