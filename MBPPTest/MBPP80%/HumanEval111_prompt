import itertools
def remove_duplicate(list1):
 list.sort(list1)
 remove_duplicate = list(list1 for list1,_ in itertools.groupby(list1))
 return remove_duplicate
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_duplicate` takes a list `list1` as input.
2. The list is first sorted using `list.sort(list1)` to group duplicates together.
3. `itertools.groupby` is used to group consecutive identical elements.
4. For each group, only the first element is taken (using `list1` in the generator expression).
5. The result is converted to a list and returned.
6.
