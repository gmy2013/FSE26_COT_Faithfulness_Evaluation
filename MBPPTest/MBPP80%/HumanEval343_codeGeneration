CodeGeneration:
ding the position of the first number.

However, the current implementation has a potential issue: if there are no numbers in the text, the function will return `None` (since the loop won't execute and there's no explicit return statement). To make this more robust, we should handle the case where no numbers are found.

Here's the improved implementation:

```python
import re

def num_position(text):
    """
    Find the starting index of the first occurrence of a number in the text.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to search for numbers
        
    Returns:
        int: The starting index of the first number found, or -1 if no numbers are found
    """
    for m in re.finditer(r"\d+", text):
        return m.start()
    return -1
```

This version:
1. Uses a raw string `r"\d+"` for the regex pattern (good practice)
2. Returns -1 if no numbers are found (consistent with common string search conventions)
3. Includes proper docstring documentation
4. Maintains the efficient early return behavior for the first match found
