CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it's designed to perform element-wise addition of two lists. However, there's a potential issue with the current implementation - it assumes both lists have the same length, which could cause an IndexError if they don't match.

Here's an improved version with proper error handling:

```python
def sum_list(lst1, lst2):
    """
    Returns the element-wise sum of two lists.
    
    Args:
        lst1 (list): First list of numbers
        lst2 (list): Second list of numbers
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list where each element is the sum of corresponding elements from lst1 and lst2
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input lists have different lengths
    """
    if len(lst1) != len(lst2):
        raise ValueError("Input lists must have the same length")
    
    res_list = [lst1[i] + lst2[i] for i in range(len(lst1))]
    return res_list
```

Alternatively, here's a more Pythonic version using `zip()`:

```python
def sum_list(lst1, lst2):
    """
    Returns the element-wise sum of two lists.
    
    Args:
        lst1 (list): First list of numbers
        lst2 (list): Second list of numbers
    
    Returns:
        list: A new list where each element is the sum of corresponding elements from lst1 and lst2
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input lists have different lengths
    """
    if len(lst1) != len(lst2):
        raise ValueError("Input lists must have the same length")
    
    return [a + b for a, b in zip(lst1, lst2)]
```

The zip version is generally preferred as it's more readable and Pythonic, while still maintaining the same functionality with proper error handling.
