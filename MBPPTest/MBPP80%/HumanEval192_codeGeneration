CodeGeneration:
Based on the docstring and the chain of thought provided, here's the complete function with the appropriate docstring:

```python
def last(arr, x, n):
    """
    Find the last occurrence of element x in a sorted array arr of size n.
    
    Args:
        arr: A sorted list of elements
        x: The element to search for
        n: The size of the array
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the last occurrence of x, or -1 if not found
    """
    low = 0
    high = n - 1
    res = -1  
    while (low <= high):
        mid = (low + high) // 2 
        if arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            res = mid
            low = mid + 1
    return res
```

The function implements a binary search algorithm that efficiently finds the last occurrence of element `x` in the sorted array by continuing to search the right half even after finding a match, ensuring the rightmost occurrence is captured.
