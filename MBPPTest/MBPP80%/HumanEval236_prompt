The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `cube_Sum(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` odd numbers.
2. The odd numbers are generated as `(2*i + 1)` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
3. For each `i`, we compute the cube of `(2*i + 1)` and add it to the running total `sum`.
4. After iterating through all `n` terms, the accumulated `sum` is returned.
5. This approach direct
