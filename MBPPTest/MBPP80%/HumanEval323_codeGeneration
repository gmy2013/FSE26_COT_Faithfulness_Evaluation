CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided function and your chain of thought, here's the complete implementation:

```python
def max_of_two(x, y):
    """Return the maximum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number
        
    Returns:
        The larger of the two input numbers
    """
    if x > y:
        return x
    return y
```

The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum of two numbers by:
1. Comparing `x` and `y` using the `>` operator
2. Returning `x` if it's greater than `y`
3. Returning `y` in all other cases (when `y` is greater than or equal to `x`)

This implementation handles all numeric types (integers, floats, etc.) and will return the larger value regardless of which parameter contains it.
