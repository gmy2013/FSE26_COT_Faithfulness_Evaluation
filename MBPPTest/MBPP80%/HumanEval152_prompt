def min_k(test_list, K):
  res = sorted(test_list, key = lambda x: x[1])[:K]
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `min_k` takes two arguments: `test_list` (a list of elements) and `K` (an integer).
2. The goal is to return the first `K` elements from `test_list` when sorted by the second element of each sub-element (assuming each element in `test_list` is a tuple or list with at least two elements).
3. The solution uses `sorted()` with a `key` function: `lambda x: x[1]` to sort by the second element.
4. It then slices the sorted list to get the first `K` elements using `[:K]`.
