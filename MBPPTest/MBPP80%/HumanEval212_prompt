def string_length(str1):
    count = 0
    for char in str1:
        count += 1
    return count
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `string_length` takes one argument `str1`, which is expected to be a string.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of characters.
3. Iterate over each character in the string `str1` using a for loop.
4. For each character encountered, increment `count` by 1.
5. After processing all characters, return the total count, which represents the length of the string.
6. This approach manually counts
