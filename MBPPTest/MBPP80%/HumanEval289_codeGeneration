CodeGeneration:
Looking at this function, I can see it's designed to find the first index where two arrays differ, but there's an issue with the implementation. The function assumes both arrays have at least n elements, which could cause an IndexError if arr2 is shorter than arr1. Let me provide a more robust implementation:

```python
def find_Extra(arr1, arr2, n):
    """
    Find the first index where two arrays differ within the first n elements.
    
    Args:
        arr1: First array to compare
        arr2: Second array to compare
        n: Number of elements to compare
    
    Returns:
        int: Index of first differing element, or n if all elements match
    """
    # Compare only up to the minimum length to avoid IndexError
    min_length = min(len(arr1), len(arr2), n)
    
    for i in range(min_length):
        if arr1[i] != arr2[i]:
            return i
    
    # If we reach here, check if arrays have different lengths within n
    if len(arr1) > len(arr2) and len(arr2) < n:
        return len(arr2)
    elif len(arr2) > len(arr1) and len(arr1) < n:
        return len(arr1)
    
    return min_length
```

Alternatively, if you want to maintain the original behavior but make it safer:

```python
def find_Extra(arr1, arr2, n):
    """
    Find the first index where two arrays differ within the first n elements.
    Assumes both arrays have at least n elements.
    
    Args:
        arr1: First array to compare (must have at least n elements)
        arr2: Second array to compare (must have at least n elements)
        n: Number of elements to compare
    
    Returns:
        int: Index of first differing element, or n if all elements match
    """
    # Safety check to prevent IndexError
    if len(arr1) < n or len(arr2) < n:
        raise ValueError("Both arrays must have at least n elements")
    
    for i in range(n):
        if arr1[i] != arr2[i]:
            return i
    return n
```

The first version is more robust and handles arrays of different lengths gracefully, while the second version maintains the original assumption but adds explicit error checking.
