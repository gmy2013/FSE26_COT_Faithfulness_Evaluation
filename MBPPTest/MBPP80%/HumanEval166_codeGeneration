CodeGeneration:
I'll complete the function based on the docstring and your chain of thought. The function counts pairs of elements in an array that sum to a target value.

```python
def get_Pairs_Count(arr, n, sum):
    """
    Count the number of pairs in an array that sum to a target value.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): List of numbers
        n (int): Length of the list
        sum (int): Target sum value
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of pairs that sum to the target value
    """
    count = 0  
    for i in range(0, n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[i] + arr[j] == sum:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This implementation follows your chain of thought:
- Initializes a counter to track valid pairs
- Uses nested loops to check all unique pairs (i, j) where i < j
- For each pair, checks if their sum equals the target value
- Returns the total count of valid pairs

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) since it checks all possible pairs, and the space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.
