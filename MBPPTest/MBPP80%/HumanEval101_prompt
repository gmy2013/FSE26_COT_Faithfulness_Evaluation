The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the given code:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The `removals` function aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove from an array such that the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the remaining subarray is at most `k`.

2. **Sorting Strategy**: The array is first sorted to enable efficient binary search operations and to easily identify valid contiguous subarrays.

3. **Binary Search Helper**: The `find_ind` function performs a binary search to find the largest index `j` (starting from `i+1`) such that `arr[j] - arr[i] <= k`. This identifies the longest valid contiguous subarray starting at index `i`.

4. **Sliding Window Approach**: For each starting index `i`, the algorithm finds the maximum ending index `j` where the subarray `arr[i..j]` satisfies the condition `arr[j] - arr[i] <= k`.

5. **Optimal Solution Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the minimum removals needed by considering all possible starting positions and finding the longest valid contiguous subarray for each, then taking the minimum of `n - (j - i + 1)` across all valid subarrays.

6. **Edge Case Handling**: The initia
