gic is correct and efficient for the given requirement.

Here's the complete function with improved formatting:

```python
def check(string):
    """Check if a string contains at least 5 different vowels (case-insensitive).
    
    Args:
        string: Input string to check for vowels
        
    Returns:
        str: 'accepted' if string contains at least 5 different vowels, 
             'not accepted' otherwise
    """
    if len(set(string).intersection("AEIOUaeiou")) >= 5:
        return 'accepted'
    else:
        return "not accepted"
```

The function works correctly as it:
1. Converts the input string to a set of unique characters
2. Finds the intersection with all vowel characters (both uppercase and lowercase)
3. Checks if there are at least 5 vowels in the intersection
4. Returns the appropriate response based on the result
