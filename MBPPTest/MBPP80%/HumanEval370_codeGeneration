1` (adding one segment).
3. **Return Result**: After processing, `dp[n]` holds the maximum segments for length `n` (or `-1` if unreachable).

Here is the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def maximum_segments(n, a, b, c):
    """
    Given a rod of length n and three segment lengths a, b, and c,
    find the maximum number of segments that can be cut from the rod
    using segments of lengths a, b, and c (any number of times each).

    Args:
        n (int): Total length of the rod.
        a (int): First segment length.
        b (int): Second segment length.
        c (int): Third segment length.

    Returns:
        int: Maximum number of segments, or -1 if not possible.
