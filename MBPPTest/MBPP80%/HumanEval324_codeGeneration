CodeGeneration:
cessing all elements.

However, note that the function name has a typo: it's spelled `mutiple_tuple` instead of `multiple_tuple`. But since the problem asks to complete the function based on the given docstring and code, we'll keep the name as is.

Here is the completed function:

```python
def mutiple_tuple(nums):
    """
    Calculate the product of all elements in the given tuple.

    Args:
        nums (tuple): A tuple of numbers (integers or floats).

    Returns:
        int or float: The product of all elements in the tuple.
    """
    temp = list(nums)
    product = 1 
    for x in temp:
        product *= x
    return product
```
