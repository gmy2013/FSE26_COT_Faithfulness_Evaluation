CodeGeneration:
I understand the issue. Modifying a list while iterating over it can cause elements to be skipped because the iteration index gets out of sync with the list's actual contents. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def remove_negs(num_list):
    """
    Remove all negative numbers from the given list.
    
    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of numbers
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list with all negative numbers removed
        
    Example:
        >>> remove_negs([1, -2, 3, -4, 5])
        [1, 3, 5]
    """
    return [item for item in num_list if item >= 0]
```

Alternative implementation using a while loop (if you prefer not to use list comprehension):

```python
def remove_negs(num_list):
    """
    Remove all negative numbers from the given list.
    
    Args:
        num_list (list): A list of numbers
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list with all negative numbers removed
    """
    result = []
    for item in num_list:
        if item >= 0:
            result.append(item)
    return result
```

Both solutions avoid modifying the list while iterating over it, which was the main issue with the original implementation. The list comprehension version is more Pythonic and concise.
