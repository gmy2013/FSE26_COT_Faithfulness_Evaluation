CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr, n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of products of all contiguous subarrays in the given array.
    
    This function uses an efficient approach that processes the array from right to left,
    accumulating the contribution of each element to all subarray products that include it.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): Input array of numbers
        n (int): Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        int/float: Sum of products of all contiguous subarrays
    
    Example:
        >>> sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1, 2, 3], 3)
        20
        # Explanation: Subarrays: [1]=1, [2]=2, [3]=3, [1,2]=2, [2,3]=6, [1,2,3]=6
        # Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 6 + 6 = 20
    """
    ans = 0
    res = 0
    i = n - 1
    while (i >= 0):
        incr = arr[i]*(1 + res)
        ans += incr
        res = incr
        i -= 1
    return (ans)
```

The function efficiently computes the sum of all contiguous subarray products using a dynamic programming approach that processes the array from right to left, accumulating the contribution of each element to extend subarrays from the right side.
