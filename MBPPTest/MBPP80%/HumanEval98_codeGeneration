CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought, the function appears to be correctly implemented. Here's the complete function with the given implementation:

```python
def min_Swaps(str1, str2):
    """
    Calculate the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to make two strings identical.
    
    Args:
        str1 (str): First input string
        str2 (str): Second input string
    
    Returns:
        int or str: Minimum number of swaps if possible, "Not Possible" otherwise
    
    The function works by:
    1. Counting mismatches between the two strings
    2. If mismatch count is even, returns half the count (each swap fixes 2 mismatches)
    3. If mismatch count is odd, returns "Not Possible" (impossible to fix all mismatches)
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if str1[i] != str2[i]:
            count += 1
    if count % 2 == 0:
        return (count // 2)
    else:
        return ("Not Possible")
```

The implementation correctly follows the chain of thought:
- It iterates through both strings to count mismatches
- It checks if the mismatch count is even (returning half the count)
- It handles the impossible case when mismatch count is odd
- The function assumes both strings are of equal length (a reasonable assumption for this problem)
