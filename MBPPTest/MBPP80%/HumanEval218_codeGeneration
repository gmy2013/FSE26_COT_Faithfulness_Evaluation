CodeGeneration:
Here's the completed function with the corrected code:

```python
def count_duplic(lists):
    """
    Count consecutive duplicate elements in a sorted list.
    
    Args:
        lists: A sorted list of elements (must be sorted for accurate results)
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (element, frequency) where:
            - element: list of unique elements in order of appearance
            - frequency: list of consecutive frequencies for each element
    
    Example:
        >>> count_duplic([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])
        ([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 3, 1])
    """
    element = []
    frequency = []
    if not lists:
        return element, frequency
    running_count = 1
    for i in range(len(lists)-1):
        if lists[i] == lists[i+1]:
            running_count += 1
        else:
            frequency.append(running_count)
            element.append(lists[i])
            running_count = 1
    frequency.append(running_count)
    element.append(lists[-1])
    return element, frequency
```

Key changes made:
1. Fixed the return statement for empty lists to return both empty lists as a tuple
2. Changed `lists[i+1]` to `lists[-1]` in the final append to handle edge cases more reliably
3. Added proper docstring with parameter descriptions, return value explanation, and example
4. Added note that the input list should be sorted for accurate results

The function now correctly handles consecutive duplicate counting and returns a tuple of (elements, frequencies).
