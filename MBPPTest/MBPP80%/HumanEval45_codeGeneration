) and then cubes it.

Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def No_of_cubes(N, K):
    """
    Calculate the number of cubes of side length K that can fit inside a larger cube of side length N.
    
    Args:
        N (int): Side length of the larger cube
        K (int): Side length of the smaller cubes
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of K-sized cubes that can fit in the N-sized cube
    """
    No = 0
    No = (N - K + 1)
    No = pow(No, 3)
    return No
```

The function correctly implements the mathematical formula for counting the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside a larger cube by:
1. Calculating the number of positions along one dimension: (N - K + 1)
2. Cubing this value to account for all three dimensions of the cube
3. Returning the result

This follows the standard combinatorial approach for counting sub-cubes within a larger cube.
