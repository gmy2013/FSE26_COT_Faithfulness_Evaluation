CodeGeneration:
The function is already correctly implemented. Here's the complete code:

```python
def min_of_two(x, y):
    if x < y:
        return x
    return y
```

This function:
- Takes two parameters `x` and `y`
- Returns `x` if `x` is less than `y`
- Returns `y` otherwise (when `y` is less than or equal to `x`)
- Correctly finds the minimum of two values

The implementation is concise and handles all cases appropriately.
