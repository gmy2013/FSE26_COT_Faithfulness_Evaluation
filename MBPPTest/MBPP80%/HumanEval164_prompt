The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `is_polite(n)` aims to compute the nth polite number.
2. Polite numbers are positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
3. The formula used is based on the known mathematical relationship: the nth polite number is given by `n + floor(log2(n + log2(n)))`.
4. Step-by-step breakdown:
   - Increment n by 1: `n = n + 1` (this adjusts for 1-indexing, as the first polite number is 3 when n=1).
   - Compute the inner logarithm: `math.log(n, 2)` gives log base 2 of n.
   - Add n to that value: `n + math.log(n, 2)`.
   - Take log base 2 of that sum: `math.log((n + math.log(n, 2)), 2)`.
   - Add n to this logarithm: `n + math.log(...)`.
   - Convert to integer (which
