CodeGeneration:
The function you provided is already correct and complete. Here's the full implementation:

```python
def mul_even_odd(list1):
    first_even = next((el for el in list1 if el%2==0),-1)
    first_odd = next((el for el in list1 if el%2!=0),-1)
    return (first_even*first_odd)
```

This function will:
- Find the first even number in the list (or return -1 if none exists)
- Find the first odd number in the list (or return -1 if none exists)
- Return the product of these two values

The implementation is efficient as it uses generator expressions with `next()` which stops searching once the first matching element is found, rather than processing the entire list unnecessarily.
