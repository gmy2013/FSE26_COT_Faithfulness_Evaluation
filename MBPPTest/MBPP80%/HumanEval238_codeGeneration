CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis, here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def sort_tuple(tup):
    """
    Sorts a tuple of tuples based on the first element of each inner tuple.
    
    Args:
        tup: A tuple containing tuples to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A new tuple with inner tuples sorted by their first element
    """
    # Convert to list for mutability, sort using bubble sort, then convert back
    lst = list(tup)
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if lst[j][0] > lst[j + 1][0]:
                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]
    return tuple(lst)
```

Alternative implementation using Python's built-in sorted() function:

```python
def sort_tuple(tup):
    """
    Sorts a tuple of tuples based on the first element of each inner tuple.
    
    Args:
        tup: A tuple containing tuples to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A new tuple with inner tuples sorted by their first element
    """
    return tuple(sorted(tup, key=lambda x: x[0]))
```

The second implementation is more Pythonic and efficient, using the built-in sorted() function with a lambda function as the key to specify sorting by the first element of each inner tuple.
