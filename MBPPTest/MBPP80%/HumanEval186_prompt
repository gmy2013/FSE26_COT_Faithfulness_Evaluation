def text_match_three(text):
        patterns = 'ab{3}?'
        if re.search(patterns,  text):

        else:
                return('Not matched!')
The following is chain of thought:
1. Analyze the regex pattern: 'ab{3}?' means match 'a' followed by exactly 3 'b's (non-greedy quantifier, but since it's exact count, greediness doesn't matter).
2. Check if the pattern exists in the input text using re.search().
3. Return 'Found a match!' if pattern is found, otherwise return 'Not matched!'.
4.
