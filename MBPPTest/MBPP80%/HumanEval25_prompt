def triangle_area(r) :  
    if r < 0 : 
        return -1
    return r * r 
The following is chain of thought:
The function name "triangle_area" suggests calculating area of a triangle, but the implementation returns r² which is the area of a square.

Chain of thought:
1. Function name indicates it should calculate triangle area
2. Current implementation returns r² (square area)
3. Triangle area formula is (base × height)/2
4. If r represents base/height, triangle area should be (r × r)/2
5. Need to modify return statement to use triangle area formula
