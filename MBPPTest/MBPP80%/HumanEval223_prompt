def remove_even(l):
    for i in l:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            l.remove(i)
    return l
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `remove_even(l)` aims to remove all even integers from the list `l`.
2. The current implementation uses a for-loop to iterate over each element `i` in the list.
3. For each element, it checks if `i % 2 == 0` (i.e., if it's even).
4. If true, it removes that element from the list using `l.remove(i)`.
5. Finally, it returns the modified list.

However, there is a critical issue with this approach: modifying a list while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior because the iteration index gets disrupted when elements are removed. For example, if two consecutive even numbers exist, the second might be skipped.

To fix this, we should either:
   a) Iterate over a copy of the list, or
   b) Use list comprehension to create a new list with only the odd numbers.

Given the docstring doesn't specify whether to modify the original list or return a new one, but the current code modifies in-place, we'll maintain that behavior but correct the iteration problem.

We can iterate backwards or use a while loop, but a simpler and more efficient approach is to use list comprehension to filter the odds and then update the original list.

Alternatively, we can create a new list and return it, but to match the current in-place modification, we'll clear the original and extend it with the odds.

Let's implement the fix:

Plan:
1. Use list comprehension to get all odd elements: `[x for x in l if x % 2 != 0]`
2. Cle
