Here's the completed function based on the docstring:

```python
import re

def replace_specialchar(text):
    """
    Replace all occurrences of space, comma, or period with a colon in the given text.
    
    Args:
        text (str): The input string to process.
    
    Returns:
        str: The modified string with special characters replaced by colons.
    
    Examples:
        >>> replace_specialchar("Hello, world. How are you?")
        'Hello::world::How:are:you?'
        >>> replace_specialchar("a b,c.d")
        'a:b:c:d'
    """
    return (re.sub("[ ,.]", ":", text))
```

The function replaces spaces, commas, and periods with colons using regular expression substitution. The pattern `[ ,.]` matches any single character that is either a space, comma, or period, and replaces each occurrence with a colon.
