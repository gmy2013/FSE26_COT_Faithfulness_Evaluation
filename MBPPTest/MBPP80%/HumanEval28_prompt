The following is chain of thought:
1. Analyze the function name and purpose: The function is named `Split` but based on the implementation, it filters even numbers from a list.
2. Check the input parameter: Takes a single parameter `list` (which should be a list of numbers).
3. Examine the implementation:
   - Creates an empty list `ev_li` to store even numbers
   - Iterates through each element in the input list
   - Checks if the element is even using modulo operation `i % 2 == 0`
   - Appends even numbers to `ev_li`
   - Returns the list of even numbers
4. Note the limitation: The function only returns even numbers, not both even and odd as the name "Split" might suggest.
5. Consider edge cases: The function handles empty lists correctly (returns em
