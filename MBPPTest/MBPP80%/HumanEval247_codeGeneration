lementation is correct and matches the formula. No changes are needed.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def area_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
    """Calculate the area of a trapezium.
    
    Args:
        base1 (float): Length of the first base
        base2 (float): Length of the second base
        height (float): Height of the trapezium
        
    Returns:
        float: Area of the trapezium calculated as 0.5 × (base1 + base2) × height
    """
    area = 0.5 * (base1 + base2) * height
    return area
```
