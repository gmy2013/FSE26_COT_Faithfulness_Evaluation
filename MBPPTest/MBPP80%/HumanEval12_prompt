def maximum_value(test_list):
  res = [(key, max(lst)) for key, lst in test_list]
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `maximum_value` takes one argument `test_list`, which is expected to be a list of tuples.
2. Each tuple in `test_list` contains two elements: a key and a list of numbers.
3. The goal is to create a new list where each tuple contains the original key and the maximum value from its associated list.
4. Use a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in `test_list`.
5. For each tuple, unpack the key and the list.
6. Apply the `max()` function to the list to find its maximum value.
7. Form a new
