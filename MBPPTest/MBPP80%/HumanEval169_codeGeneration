CodeGeneration:
rn the total sum `sm`.

However, note that the variable `j` is not necessary since we can compute the expression directly. We can simplify the code for clarity and efficiency.

Here's the improved function:

```python
def odd_Num_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the fourth powers of the first n odd numbers.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of odd terms to include in the sum.

    Returns:
        int: Sum of the fourth powers of the first n odd numbers.
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        odd_num = 2 * i - 1
        total += odd_num ** 4
    return total
```

Alternatively, we can use a more Pythonic approach with a generator expression:

```python
def odd_Num_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of the fourth powers of the first n odd numbers.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of odd terms to include in the sum.

    Returns:
        int: Sum of the fourth powers of the first n odd numbers.
    """
    return sum((2*i - 1)**4 for i in range(1, n + 1))
```

Both versions accomplish the same result, but the second one is more concise and Pythonic.
