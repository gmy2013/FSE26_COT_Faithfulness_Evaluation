Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def count_tuplex(tuplex, value):
    """
    Count the number of occurrences of a value in a tuple.
    
    Parameters:
    tuplex (tuple): The tuple to search in
    value: The value to count occurrences of
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of times the value appears in the tuple
    """
    count = tuplex.count(value)
    return count
```

The function uses the built-in `count()` method of tuples to efficiently count occurrences of the specified value and returns the result.
