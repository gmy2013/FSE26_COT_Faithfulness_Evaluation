CodeGeneration:
e is correct and follows the chain of thought. Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    """
    Return a list of numbers between startnum and endnum (inclusive) where 
    every non-zero digit of the number divides the number itself.
    
    Args:
        startnum (int): The starting number of the range
        endnum (int): The ending number of the range (inclusive)
    
    Returns:
        list: List of numbers where all non-zero digits divide the number
    """
    return [n for n in range(startnum, endnum+1) \
                if not any(map(lambda x: int(x) == 0 or n%int(x) != 0, str(n)))]
```

The function efficiently checks each number by:
1. Converting the number to a string to access individual digits
2. Using `map()` to apply the check to each digit
3. Using `any()` with negation to ensure ALL digits pass the condition
4. Handling the zero digit case to avoid division by zero

The list comprehension creates a clean, readable solution that matches the problem requirements.
