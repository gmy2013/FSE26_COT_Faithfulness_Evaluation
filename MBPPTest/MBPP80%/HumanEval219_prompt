def check_monthnum_number(monthnum1):
  if monthnum1 == 2:
    return True
  else:
    return False
The following is chain of thought:
1. Analyze the function name: `check_monthnum_number` suggests checking if a month number has a specific property.
2. Check the condition: The function returns True only when `monthnum1 == 2` (February).
3. Identify the pattern: This appears to be checking if the month is February (month number 2).
4. Consider the context: February is the only month with exactly 28 days (or 29 in leap years), making it unique.
5. Final interpretation: The function checks if the given month number corresponds to February.

Chain of thought:
- Function checks if input equals 2 (February)
- Returns True only for February
- R
