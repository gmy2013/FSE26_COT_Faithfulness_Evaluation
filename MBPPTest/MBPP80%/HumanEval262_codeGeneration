urning 1
- Duplicates by removing them before processing
- Negative numbers since sorting works with negatives
- Non-consecutive sequences correctly

Here's the complete function with improved variable names and comments:

```python
def find_longest_conseq_subseq(arr, n):
    """
    Find the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in an array.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        int: Length of the longest consecutive subsequence
    
    Example:
        >>> find_longest_conseq_subseq([1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2], 7)
        4  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    """

    arr.sort()
    
    # Remove duplicates while preserving order
    unique_elements = []
    unique_elements.append(arr[0])
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            unique_elements.append(arr[i])

    current_length = 1
