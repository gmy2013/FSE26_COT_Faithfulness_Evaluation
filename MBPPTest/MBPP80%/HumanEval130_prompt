def lateralsurface_cone(r,h):
  l = math.sqrt(r * r + h * h)
  LSA = math.pi * r  * l
  return LSA
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function calculates the lateral surface area of a cone.
2. The formula requires the slant height (l), which is computed using the Pythagorean theorem: l = √(r² + h²).
3. The lateral surface area is then calculated as π * r * l.
4. The computed value is returned.
5. The function co
