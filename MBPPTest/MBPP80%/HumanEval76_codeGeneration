CodeGeneration:
The function you provided is correct and follows the triangle angle sum property. However, I notice the docstring is missing. Here's the complete function with an appropriate docstring:

```python
def validity_triangle(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if three angles can form a valid triangle.
    
    According to the triangle angle sum property, the sum of interior angles
    of a triangle must equal 180 degrees.
    
    Args:
        a (float): First angle in degrees
        b (float): Second angle in degrees  
        c (float): Third angle in degrees
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if angles form a valid triangle, False otherwise
    """
    total = a + b + c
    if total == 180:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The function correctly implements the logic to validate triangle angles by checking if their sum equals 180 degrees.
