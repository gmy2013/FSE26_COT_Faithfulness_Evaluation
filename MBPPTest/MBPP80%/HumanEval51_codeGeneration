CodeGeneration:
Based on the function name and the code provided, it appears the intended purpose is to flatten a matrix (list of lists) into a single list. Here's the corrected implementation with an appropriate docstring:

```python
def matrix_to_list(test_list):
    """
    Flattens a matrix (list of lists) into a single list.
    
    Args:
        test_list (list): A matrix represented as a list of lists
        
    Returns:
        list: A flattened list containing all elements from the matrix
        
    Example:
        >>> matrix_to_list([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        [1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> matrix_to_list([['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']])
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    """
    return [ele for sub in test_list for ele in sub]
```
