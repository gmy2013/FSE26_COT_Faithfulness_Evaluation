CodeGeneration:
Based on your chain of thought analysis, I can see that the function is already correctly implemented to perform element-wise subtraction between two nested tuples. Here's the complete function with proper formatting:

```python
def substract_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """
    Performs element-wise subtraction between two nested tuples.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1 (tuple): First nested tuple containing numerical elements
        test_tup2 (tuple): Second nested tuple with same dimensions as test_tup1
    
    Returns:
        tuple: Nested tuple containing element-wise differences (test_tup1 - test_tup2)
    
    Example:
        >>> substract_elements(((1, 2), (3, 4)), ((0, 1), (1, 2)))
        ((1, 1), (2, 2))
    """
    res = tuple(tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
               for tup1, tup2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
    return res
```

The function correctly implements:
- Outer zip() to iterate through corresponding inner tuples
- Inner zip() to iterate through corresponding elements within each inner tuple
- Element-wise subtraction (a - b)
- Proper tuple construction at both inner and outer levels

Note: The function assumes both input tuples have identical dimensions and contain numerical elements that support subtraction.
