CodeGeneration:
ready returns a list) and return it.

Here is the complete function:

```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def n_common_words(text, n):
    """Return the n most common words in the text along with their frequencies.
    
    Args:
        text (str): Input text to analyze
        n (int): Number of most common words to return
        
    Returns:
        list: List of tuples containing (word, frequency) for the n most common words
    """
    words = re.findall('\w+', text.lower())
    n_common_words = Counter(words).most_common(n)
    return n_common_words
```

I've added `.lower()` to convert all words to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive counting (e.g., "The" and "the" are treated as the same word), which is typically the desired behavior for word frequency analysis.
