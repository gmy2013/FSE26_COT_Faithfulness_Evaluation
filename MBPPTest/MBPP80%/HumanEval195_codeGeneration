CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function, I can see that it already implements the logic described in the chain of thought. The function correctly:

1. Takes a dictionary as input
2. Initializes a sum variable to 0
3. Iterates through all values in the dictionary
4. Accumulates the sum of all values
5. Returns the total sum

The function is complete and functional as written. Here's the same code with some minor improvements for readability:

```python
def return_sum(dictionary):
    """Return the sum of all values in the given dictionary.
    
    Args:
        dictionary (dict): A dictionary with numeric values
        
    Returns:
        int/float: The sum of all values in the dictionary
    """
    total = 0
    for value in dictionary.values():
        total += value
    return total
```

The improvements made:
- Renamed parameter from `dict` to `dictionary` to avoid shadowing the built-in `dict` type
- Renamed variable from `sum` to `total` to avoid shadowing the built-in `sum()` function
- Used `+=` operator for more concise addition
- Added a proper docstring with parameter and return type documentation

However, the original function you provided is already correct and functional.
