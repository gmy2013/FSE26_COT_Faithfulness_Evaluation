CodeGeneration:
le by both (included). It also handles zero correctly if present in `nums` (since 0 is divisible by any non-zero number).

5. Final assessment: The implementation is correct and efficient for the given problem. No changes are needed.

Here is the complete function:

```python
def div_of_nums(nums, m, n):
    """Return a list of numbers from nums that are divisible by both m and n.
    
    Args:
        nums: List of numbers
        m: First divisor
        n: Second divisor
    
    Returns:
        List of numbers divisible by both m and n
    """
    result = list(filter(lambda x: (x % m == 0 and x % n == 0), nums)) 
    return result
```
