def count_tuplex(tuplex,value):  
  count = tuplex.count(value)
  return count
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `count_tuplex` takes two parameters: `tuplex` (a tuple) and `value` (the element to count).
2. The goal is to count how many times `value` appears in `tuplex`.
3. Tuples in Python have a built-in `count()` method that returns the number of occurrences of a specified value.
4. Call `tuplex.count(value)` to get the count and store it in a variable.
5.
