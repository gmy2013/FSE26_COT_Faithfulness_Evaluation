Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
import re

def road_rd(street):
    """
    Replace 'Road' at the end of a street name with 'Rd.' abbreviation.
    
    Args:
        street (str): The street name to be processed
        
    Returns:
        str: The street name with 'Road' replaced by 'Rd.' if it appears at the end
    """
    return (re.sub('Road$', 'Rd.', street))
```

The function works exactly as described in your chain of thought - it uses regex substitution to replace "Road" at the end of the string with "Rd." and returns the result.
