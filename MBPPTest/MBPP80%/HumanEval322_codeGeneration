uld be used for larger inputs. Here is the optimized dynamic programming version:

```python
def super_seq(X, Y, m, n):
    # Create a DP table of size (m+1) x (n+1)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(m + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            # If first string is empty, SCS length is length of second string
            if i == 0:
                dp[i][j] = j
            # If second string is empty, SCS length is length of first string
            elif j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = i
            # If last characters match, include it once
            elif X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            # If last characters don't match, take minimum of two possibilities
            else:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    return dp[m][n]
```

This DP solution has O(m*n) time and space complexity, making it much more efficient for practical use cases.
