def left_rotate(s,d):
    tmp = s[d : ] + s[0 : d]
    return tmp  
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `left_rotate(s, d)` takes a string `s` and an integer `d`.
2. The goal is to rotate the string `s` to the left by `d` positions.
3. To achieve this, we can split the string into two parts: from index `d` to the end, and from the start to index `d`.
4. Concatenate these two parts: the substring starting at `d` to the end comes first, followed by the substring from the start to `d`.
5. This effectively moves the first `d` characters to the end of the string.
6. Return the concatenated result.

The provided implementation correctly does this:
   - `s[d:]` gets the substring from index `d` to the end.
   - `s[0:d]` g
