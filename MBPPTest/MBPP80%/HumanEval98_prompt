The following is chain of thought:
Here's the structured chain of thought for the min_Swaps function:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The function calculates the minimum number of swaps needed to make two strings identical by swapping adjacent characters only.

2. **Key Insight**: Each swap operation can fix two mismatches at once (swapping adjacent characters corrects both positions), so the minimum number of swaps is half the number of mismatches.

3. **Edge Case**: If the number of mismatches is odd, it's impossible to make the strings identical with adjacent swaps because you'd be left with one uncorrected mismatch.

4. **Algorithm Selection**:
   - Count all positions where the two strings differ
   - If the count is even, return half the count (each swap fixes two mismatches)
   - If the count is odd, return "Not Possible"

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - Iterate through each character position in both strings
   - Increment counter when characters at the same position differ
   - Check parity of the mismatc
