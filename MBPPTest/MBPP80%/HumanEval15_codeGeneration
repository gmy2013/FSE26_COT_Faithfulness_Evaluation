CodeGeneration:
This implementation is already complete and correct. The function performs element-wise modulo operations between corresponding elements of two input tuples and returns the result as a new tuple.

Here's the complete function:

```python
def tuple_modulo(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    """Perform element-wise modulo operation between two tuples.
    
    Args:
        test_tup1: First tuple containing numeric elements
        test_tup2: Second tuple containing numeric elements (divisors)
    
    Returns:
        A new tuple where each element is the result of test_tup1[i] % test_tup2[i]
    
    Example:
        >>> tuple_modulo((10, 20, 30), (3, 7, 4))
        (1, 6, 2)
    """
    res = tuple(ele1 % ele2 for ele1, ele2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2)) 
    return res
```

The implementation correctly handles:
- Element-wise operations using `zip()`
- Modulo calculation for each pair of elements
- Conversion to a tuple for the final result
- Returning the computed tuple

The function will work with tuples of any length (as long as they're the same length) and with any numeric types that support the modulo operation.
