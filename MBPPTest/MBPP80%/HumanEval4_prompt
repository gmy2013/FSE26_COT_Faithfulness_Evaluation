def prime_num(num):
  if num >=1:
   for i in range(2, num//2):
     if (num % i) == 0:
                return False
     else:
                return True
  else:
          return False
The following is chain of thought:
The function has a logical error: it returns True after checking only the first divisor (i=2) if that division doesn't yield a remainder of 0. This means numbers like 9 (which is divisible by 3 but not by 2) would incorrectly return True.

Here's the corrected chain of thought:

1. Handle edge case: numbers ≤ 1 are not prime
2. Check divisibility by all numbers from 2 to √num (optimization: num//2 + 1)
3. If any divisor divides num evenly, return False (not prime)
4. Only after checking all possible divisors, return True (prime)
5. Special case: 2 is prime but would fail the loop condition, so handle separately

Corrected code:
```python
def prime_num(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num ==
