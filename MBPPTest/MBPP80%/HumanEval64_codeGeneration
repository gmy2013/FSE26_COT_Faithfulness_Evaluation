CodeGeneration:
The function `move_last` moves all occurrences of the first element to the end of the list while preserving the order of other elements. Here's the complete function:

```python
def move_last(num_list):
    """Move all occurrences of the first element to the end of the list.
    
    Args:
        num_list: List of numbers
        
    Returns:
        List with all occurrences of the first element moved to the end
        
    Examples:
        >>> move_last([1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 1])
        [2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1]
        >>> move_last([5, 5, 5, 5])
        [5, 5, 5, 5]
        >>> move_last([3, 2, 1])
        [2, 1, 3]
    """
    a = [num_list[0] for i in range(num_list.count(num_list[0]))]
    x = [ i for i in num_list if i != num_list[0]]
    x.extend(a)
    return (x)
```

The function works as follows:
1. `a` contains all occurrences of the first element
2. `x` contains all elements except the first element
3. The two lists are combined, placing all occurrences of the first element at the end
4. The order of non-first elements is preserved
