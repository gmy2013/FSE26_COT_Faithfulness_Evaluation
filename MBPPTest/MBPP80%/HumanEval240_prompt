The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `get_inv_count` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list) and `n` (the length of the list).
2. Initialize `inv_count` to 0 to keep track of inversion pairs.
3. Use a nested loop structure:
   - Outer loop iterates from index 0 to n-1 (i).
   - Inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1 (j).
4. For each pair (i, j), check if `arr[i] > arr[j]` (an inversion).
5. If
