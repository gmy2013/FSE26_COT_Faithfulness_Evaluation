CodeGeneration:
ck further once found).
6. Return the result `res`.

However, note that the function can be simplified using Python's built-in `in` operator for tuples, which is efficient and more Pythonic. Here's the improved version:

```python
def check_K(test_tup, K):
    """
    Check if the value K exists in the tuple test_tup.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): The tuple to search in.
        K: The value to check for existence in the tuple.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if K is found in test_tup, False otherwise.
    """
    return K in test_tup
```

This version is more concise, readable, and leverages Python's built-in functionality for membership testing.
