def are_Equal(arr1,arr2,n,m):
    if (n != m):

    return True
The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if the lengths n and m are equal. If not, return False immediately since arrays of different lengths cannot be equal.
2. Sort both arrays to bring them into a comparable order.
3. Iterate through each index from 0 to n-1 (since n = m after the first check).
4. Compare elements at each index in the sorted arrays. If any pair is not equal, return False.
5. If all elements match after the loop, return True.
