CodeGeneration:
I notice that the function `count_list` is incomplete and lacks a docstring to specify its intended behavior. Based on the function name and the current implementation, I'll provide a more meaningful implementation with a proper docstring.

```python
def count_list(input_list):
    """
    Count the number of elements in a list and return the square of that count.
    
    This function takes a list as input, calculates its length, and returns
    the square of that length value.
    
    Args:
        input_list (list): The list whose elements will be counted
        
    Returns:
        int: The square of the number of elements in the input list
        
    Examples:
        >>> count_list([1, 2, 3])
        9
        >>> count_list(['a', 'b'])
        4
        >>> count_list([])
        0
    """
    return (len(input_list))**2
```

If you intended a different behavior for the `count_list` function, please provide the specific docstring or requirements, and I'll be happy to implement it accordingly.
