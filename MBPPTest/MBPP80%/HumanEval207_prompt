The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `check_K` takes two parameters: `test_tup` (a tuple) and `K` (a value to check for).
2. Initialize a variable `res` to `False`, assuming `K` is not found initially.
3. Iterate through each element `ele` in the tuple `test_tup`.
4. For each element, check if it equals `K`.
5. If found, set `res` to `True` and break out of the loop early (since no need to che
