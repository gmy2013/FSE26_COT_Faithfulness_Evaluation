CodeGeneration:
Here's the complete function with improved docstring and edge case handling:

```python
def chunk_tuples(test_tup, N):
    """
    Split a tuple into smaller chunks of specified size.
    
    Args:
        test_tup (tuple): The input tuple to be chunked
        N (int): The size of each chunk
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of tuples where each tuple contains N elements from the original tuple.
              If the original tuple length is not divisible by N, the last chunk will be smaller.
    
    Examples:
        >>> chunk_tuples((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 2)
        [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
        >>> chunk_tuples((1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 2)
        [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5,)]
    """
    if not isinstance(test_tup, tuple):
        raise TypeError("test_tup must be a tuple")
    if not isinstance(N, int) or N <= 0:
        raise ValueError("N must be a positive integer")
    
    res = [test_tup[i : i + N] for i in range(0, len(test_tup), N)]
    return res
```

The function now includes:
- Complete docstring with parameter descriptions, return type, and examples
- Input validation to ensure test_tup is a tuple and N is a positive integer
- Proper handling of edge cases where the tuple length isn't divisible by N
- The original efficient list comprehension approach with tuple slicing
