CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and your chain of thought, I can see that the function is already correctly implemented to calculate the perimeter of a rhombus.

The function `rombus_perimeter(a)`:
- Takes a single parameter `a` representing the side length
- Calculates perimeter using the formula `4 * a` (since all sides of a rhombus are equal)
- Returns the computed perimeter value

This implementation is mathematically correct and follows the standard formula for calculating the perimeter of a rhombus. No changes are needed to this function.

```python
def rombus_perimeter(a):
    perimeter = 4 * a
    return perimeter
```
