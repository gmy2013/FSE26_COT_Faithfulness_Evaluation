def previous_palindrome(num):
    for x in range(num-1,0,-1):
        if str(x) == str(x)[::-1]:
            return x
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `previous_palindrome` takes an integer `num` as input.
2. We need to find the largest palindrome number that is strictly less than `num`.
3. The function iterates backwards from `num-1` down to 1 using a for loop.
4. For each number `x` in this range, it checks if `x` is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it with its reverse.
5. The first palindrome found (which will be the largest since we're iterating backwards) is returned immediately.
6. If no palindrome is found (though mathematically there should always be at least 1), the function would return None after the loop completes.

The implementation correctly handles:
- Input validation: Works for integers > 1
- Edge cases: Returns the prev
