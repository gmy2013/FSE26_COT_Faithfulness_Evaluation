Here's the completed function with the corrected docstring and implementation:

```python
def min_sum_path(A):
    """
    Finds the minimum path sum from top to bottom in a triangular array.
    
    Uses dynamic programming with bottom-up approach to compute the minimum
    sum path by starting from the bottom row and working upwards.
    
    Args:
        A: List of lists representing a triangular array where each row
           has one more element than the previous row
    
    Returns:
        int: The minimum sum path from top to bottom of the triangle
    """
    memo = [None] * len(A) 
    n = len(A) - 1
    for i in range(len(A[n])): 
        memo[i] = A[n][i] 
    for i in range(len(A) - 2, -1, -1): 
        for j in range(len(A[i])): 
            memo[j] = A[i][j] + min(memo[j], memo[j + 1]) 
    return memo[0]
```

The function works by:
1. Initializing a memoization array with the bottom row values
2. Processing each row from bottom to top
3. For each element, calculating the minimum path by adding its value to the minimum of the two adjacent elements from the row below
4. Returning the top element which contains the minimum path sum
