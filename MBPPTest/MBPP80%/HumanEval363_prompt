def word_len(s): 
    s = s.split(' ')   
    for word in s:    
        if len(word)%2==0: 
            return True  
        else:
          return False
The following is chain of thought:
Let me analyze the function step by step:

1. The function splits the input string `s` into words using space as delimiter
2. It iterates through each word in the resulting list
3. For the FIRST word only, it checks if the length is even
4. If the first word has even length, it returns True
5. If the first word has odd length, it returns False
6. The function never checks beyond the first word due to the return statements

The issue: The function should return True if ANY word has even length, but currently it only checks the first word.

Correct approach: Check all words, return True immediately when finding an even-length word, return False only after checking all words.

Here's the corrected chain of thought:

1. Split the input string into words
2. Iterate through each word
3. For each word, check if its length is even
