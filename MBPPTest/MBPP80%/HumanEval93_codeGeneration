CodeGeneration:
Looking at the function and the chain of thought, I can see this is already a complete and correct implementation. The function:

1. Takes a dictionary `test_dict` where values are lists
2. Uses nested set comprehension to extract all elements from all value lists
3. Automatically removes duplicates using the set
4. Converts to a sorted list for ordered output
5. Returns the sorted unique elements

The implementation is efficient and follows Python best practices. Here's the complete function:

```python
def extract_unique(test_dict):
    res = list(sorted({ele for val in test_dict.values() for ele in val}))
    return res
```

This function will work correctly for any dictionary where the values are iterable collections (like lists, tuples, sets, etc.).
