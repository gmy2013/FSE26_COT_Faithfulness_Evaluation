CodeGeneration:
Based on the chain of thought and the problem requirements, here's the complete function implementation:

```python
def max_sum_of_three_consecutive(arr, n):
    """
    Find the maximum sum of elements where no three consecutive elements are selected.
    
    Args:
        arr: List of integers
        n: Length of the array
    
    Returns:
        Maximum sum without selecting three consecutive elements
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Create sum array to store maximum sum up to each index
    sum_arr = [0] * n
    
    # Base cases
    if n >= 1:
        sum_arr[0] = arr[0]
    if n >= 2:
        sum_arr[1] = arr[0] + arr[1]
    if n >= 3:
        # For n=3, we can take: first two, last two, or first and last
        sum_arr[2] = max(sum_arr[1], arr[1] + arr[2], arr[0] + arr[2])
    
    # Dynamic programming for n >= 4
    for i in range(3, n):
        # Three possibilities:
        # 1. Don't take current element: sum_arr[i-1]
        # 2. Take current element but skip previous: sum_arr[i-2] + arr[i]
        # 3. Take current and previous elements but skip the one before: arr[i] + arr[i-1] + sum_arr[i-3]
        sum_arr[i] = max(sum_arr[i-1], 
                        sum_arr[i-2] + arr[i], 
                        arr[i] + arr[i-1] + sum_arr[i-3])
    
    return sum_arr[n-1]
```

Key improvements made:
1. Renamed `sum` to `sum_arr` to avoid shadowing the built-in `sum()` function
2. Added proper docstring with parameter and return descriptions
3. Added explicit check for n=0 case
4. Fixed the base case for n=3 to properly consider all three valid combinations
5. Maintained the core dynamic programming logic as described in the chain of thought

The function now correctly handles the constraint of not selecting three consecutive elements while maximizing the sum.
