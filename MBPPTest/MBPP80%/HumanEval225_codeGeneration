I'll implement the corrected version of the function to properly identify triangle types based on the Pythagorean theorem and its converse.

```python
def check_Type_Of_Triangle(a, b, c):
    """
    Determines the type of triangle based on side lengths using the Pythagorean theorem.
    
    Args:
        a, b, c (float): The lengths of the three sides of the triangle
    
    Returns:
        str: The type of triangle - "Right-angled Triangle", "Obtuse-angled Triangle", 
             or "Acute-angled Triangle"
    
    Note:
        - Uses the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c² for right triangles
        - For obtuse triangles: a² + b² < c² (where c is the longest side)
        - For acute triangles: a² + b² > c² (where c is the longest side)
    """
    # Calculate squares of sides
    sqa = pow(a, 2)
    sqb = pow(b, 2)
    sqc = pow(c, 2)
    
    # Check for right triangle (Pythagorean theorem)
    if (sqa == sqb + sqc) or (sqb == sqa + sqc) or (sqc == sqa + sqb):
        return "Right-angled Triangle"
    # Check for obtuse triangle (converse of Pythagorean theorem)
    elif (sqa > sqb + sqc) or (sqb > sqa + sqc) or (sqc > sqa + sqb):
        return "Obtuse-angled Triangle"
    # Otherwise it's an acute triangle
    else:
        return "Acute-angled Triangle"
```

The key corrections made:
1. Fixed the right triangle condition to properly check if any side squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared
2. Maintained the correct obtuse triangle condition (which was already correct)
3. Kept the else case for acute triangles
4. Added proper docstring documentation explaining the function's purpose and logic

This implementation now correctly identifies triangle types based on the relationships between the squares of the side lengths.
