def substract_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
   for tup1, tup2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
Here is the structured chain of thought for the given function:

1. **Function Purpose Analysis**: The function is designed to perform element-wise subtraction between two nested tuples (tuples containing tuples)
2. **Input Structure**: Both inputs (test_tup1 and test_tup2) are expected to be tuples of tuples with the same dimensions
3. **Outer Loop Strategy**: Use zip() to iterate through corresponding inner tuples from both input tuples simultaneously
4. **Inner Operation**: For each pair of inner tuples, perform element-wise subtraction using another zip() and list comprehension
5. **Result Construction**: Convert the resulting lists back to tuples and build the final nested tuple structure
6. **Return Value**: Return the resulting nested tuple containing the element-wise differences

The implementation correct
