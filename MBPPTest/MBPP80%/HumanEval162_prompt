The following is chain of thought:
1. Sort the input array to arrange numbers in ascending order, making adjacent elements the closest.
2. Initialize `diff` to a very large value (10^20) to ensure any computed difference will be smaller initially.
3. Iterate through the sorted array from index 0 to n-2 (since we compare each element with the next one).
4. For each pair of consecutive elements, compute their absolute difference (though since the array is sorted, subtraction gives positive value).
5. Update `diff` if the current pair's
