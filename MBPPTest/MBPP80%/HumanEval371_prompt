def concatenate_nested(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = test_tup1 + test_tup2
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
We are given two nested tuples. The function should concatenate them at the top level.
 Since tuples are immutable, we can simply use the + operator to concatenate them.
 This will create a new tuple that contains all elements of test_tup1 followed by all elements of test_tup2.
 The function returns this new tuple.
