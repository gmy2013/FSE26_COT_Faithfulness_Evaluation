def parallelogram_perimeter(b,h):
  perimeter=2*(b*h)
  return perimeter
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function is named `parallelogram_perimeter` and takes two parameters: `b` (base) and `h` (height).
2. The formula used in the function is `perimeter = 2 * (b * h)`, which calculates the perimeter of a parallelogram.
3. However, this formula is incorrect for a parallelogram's perimeter. The correct formula should be `perimeter = 2 * (b + h)`.
4. The function returns the calculated per
