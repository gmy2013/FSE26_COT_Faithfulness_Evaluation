CodeGeneration:
I see you've provided a function and a chain of thought. Based on your description, the function appears to be correctly implemented to calculate the sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers.

Here's the function with proper formatting and a complete docstring:

```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    """
    Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of odd numbers to include in the sum
        
    Returns:
        int: Sum of cubes of the first n odd numbers
        
    Examples:
        >>> cube_Sum(1)
        1
        >>> cube_Sum(2)
        28
        >>> cube_Sum(3)
        153
    """
    sum = 0   
    for i in range(0, n):
        sum += (2*i + 1) * (2*i + 1) * (2*i + 1) 
    return sum
```

The function correctly implements the mathematical formula for the sum of cubes of odd numbers:
- For i = 0: (2*0 + 1)³ = 1³ = 1
- For i = 1: (2*1 + 1)³ = 3³ = 27
- For i = 2: (2*2 + 1)³ = 5³ = 125
- And so on...

This gives the sequence: 1, 28 (1+27), 153 (1+27+125), etc.
