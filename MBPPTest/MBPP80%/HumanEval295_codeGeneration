CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided chain of thought, here's the complete implementation:

```python
def last(n):
    """Return the last element of the input sequence.
    
    Args:
        n: A sequence (tuple, list, etc.) with at least one element
        
    Returns:
        The last element of the sequence
    """
    return n[-1]

def sort_list_last(tuples):
    """Sort a list of tuples based on the last element of each tuple.
    
    Args:
        tuples: A list of tuples to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        A new list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the last element
    """
    return sorted(tuples, key=last)
```

This implementation:
- Defines `last(n)` to extract the last element of any sequence
- Defines `sort_list_last(tuples)` that sorts a list of tuples using the `last` function as the key
- Uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function with the custom key function
- Returns a new sorted list without modifying the original input list
