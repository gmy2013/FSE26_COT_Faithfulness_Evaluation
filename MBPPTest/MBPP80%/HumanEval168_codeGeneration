CodeGeneration:
The function `Diff` correctly implements the symmetric difference between two lists, returning elements that are in either list but not in both. Here's the complete function with the docstring:

```python
def Diff(li1, li2):
    """
    Return the symmetric difference between two lists.
    
    The symmetric difference contains elements that are in either li1 or li2
    but not in both. Duplicates are removed from the result.
    
    Args:
        li1 (list): First input list
        li2 (list): Second input list
    
    Returns:
        list: List containing elements that are in li1 or li2 but not in both
    
    Examples:
        >>> Diff([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4])
        [1, 4]
        >>> Diff(['a', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'c', 'd'])
        ['a', 'd']
    """
    return (list(list(set(li1)-set(li2)) + list(set(li2)-set(li1))))
```
