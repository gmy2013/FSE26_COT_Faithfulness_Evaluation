def tuple_modulo(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(ele1 % ele2 for ele1, ele2 in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2)) 
  return (res) 
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function takes two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` as input.
2. It needs to perform element-wise modulo operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples.
3. The `zip()` function pairs elements from both tuples at the same positions.
4. A generator expression iterates through each pair, calculating `ele1 % ele2` for each element pair.
5. The results are converted to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor.
6. The resulting tuple containing the modulo operations is returned.
7. The implementation cor
