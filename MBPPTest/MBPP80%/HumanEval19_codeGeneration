CodeGeneration:
The function `largest_subset` is designed to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements satisfies the divisibility condition. The provided code implements a dynamic programming solution that works backwards through the list. However, there is a potential issue when `n=0` (empty list), as `max(dp)` would be called on an empty list, causing a `ValueError`. To handle this edge case, we can add a check at the beginning.

Here is the complete function with the edge case handled:

```python
def largest_subset(a, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    dp = [0 for i in range(n)]
    dp[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        mxm = 0
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if a[j] % a[i] == 0 or a[i] % a[j] == 0:
                mxm = max(mxm, dp[j])
        dp[i] = 1 + mxm
    return max(dp)
```

This code efficiently computes the largest subset size using dynamic programming, with proper handling for an empty input.
