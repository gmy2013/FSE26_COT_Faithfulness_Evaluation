def rombus_perimeter(a):
  perimeter=4*a
  return perimeter
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function name is `rombus_perimeter`, which suggests it calculates the perimeter of a rhombus.
2. The parameter `a` represents the side length of the rhombus.
3. The perimeter of a rhombus is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4 (since all sides are equal).
4. The function correctly computes `perimeter = 4 * a`.
5. The function returns the computed perimeter value.
