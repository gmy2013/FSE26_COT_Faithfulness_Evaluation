def dealnnoy_num(n, m): 
	if (m == 0 or n == 0) : 
		return 1
	return dealnnoy_num(m - 1, n) + dealnnoy_num(m - 1, n - 1) + dealnnoy_num(m, n - 1)
The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the given function and its intended behavior:

The function `dealnnoy_num(n, m)` is meant to compute the Dealnnoy number D(n, m). However, there is a critical issue: the recursive calls have the arguments reversed. The Dealnnoy number is defined recursively as:
D(m, n) = D(m-1, n) + D(m-1, n-1) + D(m, n-1)   for m, n > 0
with base cases D(0, n) = 1 and D(m, 0) = 1.

But in the provided code:
- The base condition checks for `m==0 or n==0` correctly.
- However, the recursive calls are: `dealnnoy_num(m-1, n)`, `dealnnoy_num(m-1, n-1)`, and `dealnnoy_num(m, n-1)`.

Notice that the function parameters are `(n, m)`, but the recursive calls use `(m-1, n)`, etc. This effectively swaps the roles of n and m in the recursion. This will lead to incorrect results because the recurrence relation is not being applied correctly.

To fix this, we should either:
1. Swap the parameters in the function definition to `def dealnnoy_num(m, n):` to match the standard definition, or
2. Adjust the recursive calls to use `(n-1, m)`, etc., but that would not be straightforward.

The most logical approach is to define the function with parameters in the standard order (m, n). Since the problem asks to complete the function based on the docstring (which we don't have, but we can infer from the context), we assume the function should compute D(n, m) correctly.

However, note that the Dealnnoy number is symmetric? Actually, D(m, n) is not symmetric in general. So we must be careful.

Given the code as is, it is likely intended to compute D(n, m), but the recursive calls are swapped. Let's restructure:

Correct approach for D(m, n):
Base: if m==0 or n==0: return 1
Recurrence: D(m, n) = D(m-1, n) + D(m-1, n-1) + D(m, n-1)

But our function is defined as dealnnoy_num(n, m). So to compute D(n, m), we should do:
Base: if n==0 or m==0: return 1
Recurrence: D(n, m) = D(n-1, m) + D(n-1, m-1) + D(n, m-1)

Therefore, the recursive calls should be:
dealnnoy_num(n-1, m) + dealnnoy_num(n-1, m-1) + dealnnoy_num(n, m-1)

So the corrected code is:

def dealnnoy_num(n, m):
    if n == 0 or m == 0:
        return 1
    return dealnnoy_num(n-1, m) + dealnnoy_num(n-1, m-1) + dealnnoy_num(n, m-1)

This matches the recurrence for D(n, m).

Thus, the structured chain of thought:
1. Identify the standard Dealnnoy recurrence: D(m,n) = D(m-1,n) + D(m-1,n-1) + D(m,n-1) for m,n>0, with base D(0,k)=1
