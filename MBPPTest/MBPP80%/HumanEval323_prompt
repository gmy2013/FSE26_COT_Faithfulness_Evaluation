def max_of_two( x, y ):
    if x > y:
        return x
    return y
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `max_of_two` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`.
2. It compares `x` and `y` using a conditional statement: if `x` is greater than `y`, it returns `x`.
3. If the condition is not met (i.e., `x` is not greater than `y`), it returns `y`.
4. This logic ensures that the larger of the two values is returned, handling both cases where `x` is greater or `y` is greater (or equal).
