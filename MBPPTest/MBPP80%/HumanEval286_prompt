def is_odd(n) : 
    if (n^1 == n-1) :
        return True; 
    else :
        return False; 
The following is chain of thought:
The function attempts to check if a number is odd using bitwise XOR, but the logic is flawed. Let me analyze:

1. The expression `n^1 == n-1` is incorrect for determining oddness
2. For odd numbers: `n^1` equals `n-1` (e.g., 3^1 = 2, which equals 3-1)
3. For even numbers: `n^1` equals `n+1` (e.g., 4^1 = 5, which doesn't equal 4-1=3)
4. So the condition `n^1 == n-1` actually correctly identifies odd numbers
5. However, this approach is unnecessarily complex and non-intuitive
6. The proper way is to ch
