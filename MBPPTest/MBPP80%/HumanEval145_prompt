    sectorarea = (pi*r**2) * (a/360)

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `sector_area` calculates the area of a circular sector given radius `r` and angle `a`.
2. The value of pi is approximated as 22/7.
3. If the angle `a` is 360 or greater, the function returns `None` because a full circle (360°) would be the entire area, and angles beyond 360° are not valid for a sector in this context.
4. Otherwise, the sector area
