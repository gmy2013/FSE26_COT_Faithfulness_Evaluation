import heapq as hq
def raw_heap(rawheap):
  hq.heapify(rawheap)
  return rawheap
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `raw_heap` takes a list `rawheap` as input.
2. It uses `heapq.heapify` to transform the list into a min-heap in-place.
3. It returns the heapified list.
4. Since `heapify` modifies the list in-place, the original input list will be altered.
