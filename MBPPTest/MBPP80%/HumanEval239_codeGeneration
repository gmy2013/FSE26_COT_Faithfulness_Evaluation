CodeGeneration:
Based on the provided function and the chain of thought, here is the complete function with an improved docstring that clarifies its purpose:

```python
def Check_Solution(a, b, c):
    """
    Check if a solution exists for a linear equation of the form a*x + b = c.
    
    This function specifically checks if the equation has a valid solution
    by verifying if the constant term b is zero, which may indicate
    special cases in certain contexts.
    
    Args:
        a (float): Coefficient of x (currently unused in logic)
        b (float): Constant term - determines the solution existence
        c (float): Right-hand side constant (currently unused in logic)
    
    Returns:
        str: "Yes" if b equals 0, "No" otherwise
    """
    if b == 0:
        return "Yes"
    else:
        return "No"
```

Note: The function appears to be incomplete or overly simplistic for checking equation solutions, as it doesn't consider the actual equation structure (a*x + b = c). A more comprehensive solution checker would typically verify if a valid x exists that satisfies the equation, which would involve checking if a â‰  0 (for non-degenerate cases) or handling special cases when a = 0.
