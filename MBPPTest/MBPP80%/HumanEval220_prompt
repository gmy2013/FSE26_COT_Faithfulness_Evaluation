    return merged_dict
The following is chain of thought:
1. The function `merge_dictionaries` takes two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` as input.
2. The goal is to merge these two dictionaries into a single dictionary.
3. The method uses `collections.ChainMap` to create a view that combines multiple dictionaries.
4. The `ChainMap` is constructed with an empty dictionary `{}` first, then `dict1`, then `dict2`. This ordering ensures that keys in `dict2` take precedence over `dict1`, and keys in the empty dictionary have lowest priority (but it's empty so has no effect).
5. However, `ChainMap` itself is not a dictionary but a view. Wrapping it with `dict()` converts it into a regular dictionary.
6. The merged d
