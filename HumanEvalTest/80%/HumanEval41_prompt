    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

The following is chain of thought:
The problem involves two sets of n cars each moving in opposite directions on a straight road. Since all cars move at the same speed and are infinitely sturdy (continuing after collisions), each left-to-right car will eventually collide with every right-to-left car that it meets. However, because the cars are initially far apart and moving at constant speed, the collisions occur in pairs based on their relative positions.

Actually, consider the scenario: there are n cars moving left-to-right and n cars moving right-to-left. Each left-to-right car will collide with every right-to-left car that is in its path. But since the cars are all identical in speed and start far apart, the collisions are pairwise between the two groups.

However, note that the problem does not specify the initial positions, but since they start "very far from each other", we can assume that the left-to-right cars are initially to the left of all right-to-left cars. As they move towards each other, each left-to-right car will meet each right-to-left car exactly once. Therefore, the total number of collisions is the product of the number of cars in each group, i.e., n * n = nÂ².

But wait: is that correct? Actually, if we have n cars going left-to-right and n going
