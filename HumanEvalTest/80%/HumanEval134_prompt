    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:
1. We need to check if the last character is an alphabetical character (a letter)
2. AND that it is not part of a word (meaning it should be separated by space, or be the only character)
3. A "word" is defined as a group of characters separated by space

Approach:
- If the string is empty, return False
- Check if the last character is a letter using isalpha()
- If it is a letter, we need to check if it's not part of a word:
  - If the character before it (if exists) is a space, then it's not part of a word
  - Or if it's the only character in the string (so index 0 is the last char)
- Otherwise, return False

Edge cases:
- Empty string: return False
- String ending with space: return False (last char is space, not letter)
- Single letter: should return True (it's a letter and not part of a word since no spaces)
- Last character is letter but preceded by non-space: then it's part of a word, return False

So the condition should be:
- Last character is alpha AND (it's the first character OR the character before it is a space)
But also need to handle case where last character is space (already handled by isalpha() check)

Let's implement accordingly.
```python

    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
