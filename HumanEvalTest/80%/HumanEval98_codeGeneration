0).
- Check if the character is an uppercase vowel (in 'AEIOU').
- If both conditions are true, increment the counter.
- Return the counter.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    count = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0 and char in 'AEIOU':
            count += 1
    return count
```

Let's test with the provided examples:
- 'aBCdEf': indices 0,2,4 are even. 'a' (index 0) is lowercase, 'C' (index 2) is consonant, 'E' (index 4) is uppercase vowel → count = 1
- 'abcdefg': all characters are lowercase → count = 0
- 'dBBE': indices 0,2 are even. 'd' (index 0) is lowercase, 'B' (index 2) is consonant → count = 0

The implementation correctly handles all test cases.
