CodeGeneration:
-123 has digits: -1, 2, 3 with sum (-1) + 2 + 3 = 4.

    Approach:
    1. For each number in the array:
        a. Convert the number to a string to process each digit.
        b. If the number is negative, the first character will be '-', so we need to handle that.
        c. For negative numbers, the first digit (after the sign) should be considered as negative.
        d. Sum all the digits (with the appropriate sign for negative numbers).
        e. Check if the sum > 0.

    2. Count how many numbers satisfy the condition.

    Let's implement accordingly.

        total = 0
        # If the number is negative, the first digit (after the sign) is negative.
        if s[0] == '-':
            # The first digit (at index 1) is negative.
            total -= int(s[1])
            # Then add the rest of the digits (from index 2 onwards) as positive.
            for digit_char in s[2:]:
                total += int(digit_char)
        else:
            # For positive numbers, just sum all digits.
            for digit_char in s:
                total += int(digit_char)
        if total > 0:
            count += 1
    return count
