def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
    '''

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:

1. Convert the input string to a float first to handle decimal numbers.
2. We need to round to the nearest integer, but with a special rule for .5 cases.
3. The rule: if exactly halfway between two integers, round away from zero.
4. This means positive numbers round up (e.g., 14.5 -> 15) and negative numbers round down (e.g., -14.5 -> -15).

We can implement this by:
- Checking if the fractional part is exactly 0.5 (or -0.5 for negatives).
- If so, round away from zero: for positive, ceil; for negative, floor.
- Otherwise, use normal rounding.

However, note that due to floating point precision, we should be cautious when checking for exactly 0.5.

Alternatively, we can use:
- For positive numbers: if the fractional part is exactly 0.5, we round up.
- For negative numbers: if the fractional part is exactly -0.5, we round down.

But to avoid floating point issues, we can compare with a tolerance.

Another approach: multiply by 2, round to nearest integer, then divide by 2 and round again? But that might not be straightforward.

Actually, we can use:
- Check if the absolute value of (value - round(value)) is approximately 0.5 (with tolerance). If so, then we are exactly halfway.

But note: the problem says "equidistant from two integers", which only happens when the fractional part is exactly 0.5.

So steps:
1. Convert string to float.
2. Let n = float(value)
3. Check if n is exactly halfway: i.e., abs(n - round(n)) == 0.5? But due to floating point, we might use tolerance.
4. If it is halfway:
   - If n is positive, return ceil(n)
   - If n is negative, return floor(n)
5. Otherwise, return round(n) as usual.

But wait: for negative numbers, for example -14.5: 
   round(-14.5) would be -14 (because Python rounds to even by default), but we want -15.

So we cannot rely on Python's built-in round for halfway cases.

Implementation:

We can do:
   integer_part = int(n)
   fractional = n - integer_part

But for negatives, fractional is negative.

Alternatively, we can use:
   if n >= 0:
        if n - int(n) == 0.5:
            return int(n) + 1
        else:
            return round(n)   # but careful: for positive, round(n) rounds to even for halfway, but we don't want that for exactly 0.5.
   Similarly for negative.

But to avoid floating point issues, we should compare with tolerance.

Better: represent the number as a string to avoid floating point? But the input is string, so we can parse the string to see if it ends with ".5".

However, the problem says the input is a string representing a number. It might be "14.5" or "14.500", etc.

So we can parse the string to see if it has a decimal part that is exactly 0.5.

But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, we can use decimal module for exact representation.

But for simplicity, we can use a tolerance.

Let's define:
   tol = 1e-9
   n = float(value)

   if abs(n - round(n)) - 0.5) < tol:   # meaning the distance to the nearest integer is 0.5
        if n > 0:
            return int(n) + 1
        else:
            return int(n) - 1   # because for negative, int(-14.5) is -14, but we want -15 so subtract 1.
   else:
        return round(n)

But wait: for negative, int(n) truncates towards zero. So for n = -14.5, int(n) is -14.
We want to round down to -15.

So for negative halfway, we need to go to floor(n). Actually, floor(-14.5) is -15.

So we can use:
   if abs(n - round(n)) - 0.5) < tol:
        if n > 0:
            return math.ceil(n)
        else:
            return math.floor(n)

But we need to import math.

Alternatively, without math: for positive, int(n) + 1; for negative, int(n) - 1 only if n is not integer? But for negative, if n = -14.5, int(n) is -14, so we want -15 = int(n) - 1.

So code:

   import math

   n = float(value)
   if abs(abs(n - round(n)) - 0.5) < 1e-9:
        if n > 0:
            return int(n) + 1
        else:
            return int(n) - 1
   else:
        return round(n)

But wait: what if n is exactly integer? Then the condition won't hold.

Test with n=10: no problem.

But for n=14.5: 
   round(14.5) = 14 (because Python rounds to even), but we want 15.
   So the condition: abs(14.5 - 14) = 0.5, so it matches.

Similarly for -14.5: round(-14.5) = -14 (round to even), but we want -15.
   abs(-14.5 - (-14)) = abs(-0.5) = 0.5, so matches.

So it works.

However, we can also avoid math by using:

   if n >= 0:
        if n - int(n) >= 0.5:
            return int(n) + 1
        else:
            return int(n)
   else:
        if int(n) - n >= 0.5:   # because fractional is negative
            return int(n) - 1
        else:
            return int(n)

But this doesn't handle the halfway correctly for rounding away: for positive exactly 0.5, we want to round up. So if n - int(n) == 0.5, we round up.
Similarly for negative: if the fractional part is exactly -0.5, we round down.

But with floating point, we might not get exact 0.5.

So the first method with tolerance is better.

Let's code with tolerance.

We'll define a tolerance.

Also, we can use:

   rounded = round(n)
   if abs(n - rounded) == 0.5:   # with tolerance
        if n > 0:
            return rounded + 1
        else:
            return rounded - 1
   else:
        return rounded

For n=14.5: rounded = 14, then abs(14.5-14)=0.5, so we return 15.
For n=-14.5: rounded = -14, abs(-14.5 - (-14)) = 0.5, so we return -15.

This is good.

So implementation:

   n = float(value)
   rounded = round(n)
   if abs(n - rounded) == 0.5:   # but use tolerance
        if n > 0:
            return rounded + 1
        else:
            return rounded - 1
   else:
        return rounded

Now with tolerance:

   tol = 1e-9
   if abs(abs(n - rounded) - 0.5) < tol:
        ...

But actually, we can check: if abs(n - rounded) - 0.5 < tol and abs(n - rounded) - 0.5 > -tol
But simpler: if abs( abs(n - rounded) - 0.5 ) < tol

Alternatively, we can check if the fractional part is approximately 0.5 in absolute value.

But the above should work.

Let's write the code accordingly.
