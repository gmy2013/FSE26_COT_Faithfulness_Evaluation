def digitSum(s):
    """Task
    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'
    ASCII codes.

    Examples:
        digitSum("") => 0
        digitSum("abAB") => 131
        digitSum("abcCd") => 67
        digitSum("helloE") => 69
        digitSum("woArBld") => 131
        digitSum("aAaaaXa") => 153
    """

The following is chain of thought:
First, I need to understand the task: sum the ASCII codes of uppercase characters only in a string.

Steps:
1. Initialize a variable to accumulate the sum, starting at 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. For each character, check if it is uppercase.
4. If it is uppercase, get its ASCII code using ord() and add it to the sum.
5. After processing all characters, return the sum.

Edge cases:
