CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    # Start from n//2 and go downwards to find the largest divisor
    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    
    return 1  # This line should never be reached for n > 1
```

This implementation:
1. Handles the edge case where n ≤ 1 by returning 0
2. For n > 1, starts checking from n//2 down to 1
3. Returns the first divisor found (which will be the largest one)
4. The final return statement is a safeguard that should never be reached for valid inputs

The algorithm is efficient because:
- It starts from the largest possible candidate (n//2)
- It stops immediately when it finds the first divisor
- It avoids checking numbers larger than n//2 since no divisor (other than n itself) can be larger than n//2

For n=15: n//2=7, checks 7 (not a divisor), 6 (not), 5 (divisor) → returns 5 ✓
