The following is chain of thought:
To implement `make_palindrome`, we need to find the longest palindromic suffix of the input string, then append the reverse of the remaining prefix to the end.

Chain of thought:
1. If the string is already a palindrome, return it immediately
2. Otherwise, iterate from the start to find the smallest index where the substring from that index to the end is a palindrome
3. The prefix that needs to be appended in reverse is the substring from the beginning to that index
4. Concatenate the original string with the reversed prefix

Implementation:
```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
