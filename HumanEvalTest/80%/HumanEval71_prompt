def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.
    Example:
    triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 6.00
    triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == -1
    '''

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides, but only if they form a valid triangle. The validity is determined by the triangle inequality theorem: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. If valid, we compute the area using Heron's formula and round it to two decimal places. Otherwise, return -1.

Chain of thought:
1. Check if the sides form a valid triangle: 
   - a + b > c
   - a + c > b
   - b + c > a
   If any condition fails, return -1.
2. If valid, compute the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c) / 2.
3. Apply Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)).
4. Round the area to two decimal places and return it.

Now, the code implementation:
