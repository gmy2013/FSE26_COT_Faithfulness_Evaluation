    """
    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return
    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.

    Example:

        Input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4
        Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3

    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given an array `arr` and an integer `k`.
 We need to consider the first `k` elements of the array.
 For each of these elements, we check if it has at most two digits (i.e., between -99 and 99 inclusive? But note: the example only has positive integers).
 However, the problem says "non-empty array of integers", so we should consider negative numbers as well? But the example only has positive.
 But the docstring says "at most two digits", which for negative numbers would be from -99 to -10 and also -9 to -1? Actually, the number of digits in a negative number is the same as its absolute value.
 However, note the constraints: the array contains integers. We should consider the absolute value for digit count? Actually, the problem says "digits", which typically refers to the number of digits without the sign.
 But let's look at the example: it only has positive numbers. Also, the constraints don't specify positive only, but the example input is all positive.

 To be safe, we should consider the absolute value when counting digits. However, the problem says "at most two digits". So:
   A number has at most two digits if its absolute value is less than 100 (i.e., from -99 to 99 inclusive).

 Steps:
 1. Take the first k elements from the array.
 2. For each number in these k elements, check if the absolute value of the number is less than 100 (i.e., |x| < 100).
 3. Sum all such numbers that satisfy the condition.

 Example: 
   arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4
   First 4 elements: [111, 21, 3, 4000]
   Numbers with at most two digits: 21 (because |21|=21<100) and 3 (|3|=3<100). 111 and 4000 are not.
   So sum = 21+3 = 24.

 Implementation:
   We can use a list slice to get the first k elements: arr[:k]
   Then iterate through each element in that slice, and if abs(x) < 100, add it to the total.

 However, note: what about zero? Zero has one digit. So it should be included. And abs(0)=0<100, so it will be included.

 Code:
   total = 0
   for num in arr[:k]:
        if abs(num) < 100:
            total += num
