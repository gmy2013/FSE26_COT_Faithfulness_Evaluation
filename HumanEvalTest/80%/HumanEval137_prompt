    Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing
    real numbers, and returns the larger variable in its given variable type.
    Return None if the values are equal.
    Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,

    compare_one(1, 2.5) ➞ 2.5

The following is chain of thought:
We are comparing two values that can be integers, floats, or strings representing numbers (with either '.' or ',' as decimal separator).
 Steps:
 1. Convert both inputs to a common numeric type (float) for comparison, handling the string cases appropriately.
 2. If the numeric values are equal, return None.
 3. Otherwise, return the original value (a or b) that corresponds to the larger numeric value.

 How to handle strings:
   - Replace comma with dot in the string to standardize the decimal separator.
   - Then convert to float.

 However, note: we must return the original variable (with its original type and representation) of the larger one.

 Implementation:
   Let's define a helper function to convert a value to a float for comparison:
     If the value is a string: replace ',' with '.' and then convert to float.
     Else: simply convert to float (if int or float).

   Then:
     num_a = convert_to_float(a)
     num_b = convert_to_float(b)

   If num_a == num_b: return None
   Else if num_a > num_b: return a
   Else: return b

 Important: We must be cautious with floating point precision? But the problem says "real numbers", and we are only comparing.
 However, note the example: compare_one("1", 1) returns None. So we must ensure that 1.0 and 1 are considered equal.

 But note: the problem says "Return None if the values are equal". So we are comparing the numeric values.

 Let's code accordingly.
```

```python
def compare_one(a, b):
