CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis and handling edge cases as described, here is the Python function:

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1
    if x == 1:
        return True
    if n == 0:
        return False
    k = 1
    power = n
    while power <= x:
        if power == x:
            return True
        power *= n
        k += 1
    return False
```

This function:
- Returns `True` if `x` is 1 (since any non-zero `n` raised to 0 equals 1)
- Returns `True` only if `n` is 1 and `x` is 1
- Returns `False` if `n` is 0 (since 0 raised to any positive power is 0, but 0^0 is undefined)
- Otherwise iterates through powers of `n` to check if any equals `x`

The implementation handles all cases from the examples correctly and assumes positive integer inputs as typical for this problem.
