The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. We can achieve this by iterating through each element in the input list, adding 1 to it, and collecting the results in a new list.

Chain of thought:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the incremented values.
2. Iterate over each element in the input list.
3. For each element, add 1 to it.
4. Append the result to the new list.
5. Return the new list after processing all elements.

Alternatively, we can use a list comp
