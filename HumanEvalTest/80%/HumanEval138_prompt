The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given integer `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

Key observations:
1. Since we are summing four positive even numbers, the smallest possible sum is 2+2+2+2 = 8. Therefore, any `n < 8` should return False.
2. Each even number can be represented as 2 times an integer. So, the sum of four even numbers is 2*(a + b + c + d), where a, b, c, d are positive integers. This implies that the sum must be even and at least 8.
3. However, note that the problem requires exactly four positive even numbers. This means we cannot use zero or negative numbers.

But wait: if we let the four numbers be 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d (with a,b,c,d >=1), then the sum is 2(a+b+c+d). So n must be even and at least 8.
However, is that sufficient? For example, n=8: 2+2+2+2=8 -> valid. n=10: 2+2+2+4=10 -> valid. Similarly, any even n>=8 can be written as 2 + 2 + 2 + (n-6). Since n>=8 is even, n-6 is at least 2 and even. So it seems that every even n>=8 can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.

But check the examples:
is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False -> correct (4<8)
is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False -> correct (6<8)
is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True -> correct.

So the solution is straightforward: return True if n is even and n>=8, otherwise False.

However, let me double-check with n=2: should be False (too small) -> correct.
n=12: 2+2+2+6=12 -> valid.
n=14: 2+2+2+8=14 -> valid.

Therefore, the function simply checks if n is an even integer and at least 8.

We'll check if
