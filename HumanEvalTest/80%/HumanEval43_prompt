The following is chain of thought:
Looking at the problem, I need to find if there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. Here's my thought process:

1. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, return False immediately since we need at least 2 elements
2. I'll use a set to store the numbers I've seen so far for O(1) lookups
3. For each number in the list:
   - Check if its negative counterpart exists in the set (since x + (-x) = 0)
   - If found, return True immediately
   - Add the current number to the set
4. If I finish the loop without finding a pair, return False

This approach has O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity, which is efficient.
