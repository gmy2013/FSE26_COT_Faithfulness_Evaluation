def file_name_check(file_name):
    """Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a string `file_name` and need to check four conditions:
1. There should not be more than three digits (0-9) in the entire file name.
2. The file name must contain exactly one dot '.'.
3. The substring before the dot (the base name) must not be empty and must start with a Latin alphabet letter (a-z, A-Z).
4. The substring after the dot (the extension) must be one of: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].

Steps:
1. Check the number of digits: count the digits in the string. If count > 3, return 'No'.
2. Check the number of dots: split the string by '.' and check the number of parts. If there are not exactly 2 parts (so exactly one dot), return 'No'.
3. The base name (first part) must not be empty and its first character must be a letter.
4. The extension (second part) must be in the allowed list.

Let's code accordingly.
```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    # Condition 1: Check digit count
    digit_count = sum(1 for char in file_name if char.isdigit())
    if digit_count > 3:
        return 'No'
    
    # Condition 2: Check exactly one dot
    parts = file_name.split('.')
    if len(parts) != 2:
        return 'No'
    
    base, extension
