    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    for examble:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) ->19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a string `s` that contains the number of apples and oranges, and an integer `n` that is the total number of fruits.
 The string `s` has the format: "<number> apples and <number> oranges", where <number> can be integers (including 0).
 We need to extract the two numbers from the string and subtract them from the total `n` to get the number of mangoes.

 Steps:
 1. Split the string to get the words and numbers.
 2. The first token should be the number of apples (as a string), then the word "apples", then "and", then the number of oranges, then "oranges".
 3. Convert the extracted number strings to integers.
 4. Subtract both from the total `n` to get the number of mangoes.

 Example: "5 apples and 6 oranges" -> we need to extract 5 and 6.

 Implementation:
 We can split the string by spaces. The first element is the apple count, and the fourth element (index 3) is the orange count?
 But note: the string might have numbers with multiple digits. Also, the numbers might be at index 0 and index 3? Let's check with examples.

 Example 1: "5 apples and 6 oranges" -> split: ['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges'] -> apples at index0, oranges at index3.
 Example 2: "0 apples and 1 oranges" -> same indices.
 Example 3: "100 apples and 1 oranges" -> same.

 So we can assume the string has exactly 5 words? Actually, the numbers might be multi-digit but they are single tokens.
