The following is chain of thought:
To decode a string encoded by `encode_cyclic`, we need to reverse the encoding operation. The encoding cycles each group of three characters by moving the first character to the end (e.g., "abc" becomes "bca"). Therefore, decoding requires reversing this cycle: moving the last character to the front (e.g., "bca" becomes "abc").

The steps are:
1. Split the string into groups of three characters (same as encoding).
2. For each group of exactly three characters, reverse the cycle: move the last character to the front.
3. For groups with fewer than three characters (which were not altered during encoding), leave them unchanged.
4. Join all groups to form the decoded string.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in
