CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function based on the chain of thought:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '>':
            balance -= 1
            if balance < 0:
                return False
    return balance == 0
```

This implementation follows the described algorithm:
1. Initialize a balance counter to 0
2. Iterate through each character in the string
3. For each '<', increment the balance
4. For each '>', decrement the balance and check if it becomes negative
5. If balance becomes negative at any point, return False immediately
6. After processing all characters, return True only if balance is exactly 0

The function correctly handles all the test cases provided in the docstring.
