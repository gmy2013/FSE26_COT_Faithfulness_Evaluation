CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the docstring and chain of thought:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    """
    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value
    """
    if not arr:
        return []
    
    min_even = None
    min_index = -1
    
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if number is even
            if min_even is None or num < min_even:
                min_even = num
                min_index = i
            elif num == min_even and (min_index == -1 or i < min_index):
                min_index = i
    
    if min_even is None:
        return []
    
    return [min_even, min_index]
```

This implementation:
1. First checks if the array is empty and returns an empty list if true
2. Initializes `min_even` to `None` and `min_index` to `-1` to track the smallest even value and its position
3. Iterates through each element with its index using `enumerate()`
4. For each even number, it updates the minimum value and index when:
   - No even number has been found yet
   - A smaller even number is found
   - The same minimum value is found at an earlier index
5. Returns an empty list if no even numbers were found, otherwise returns `[min_even, min_index]`
