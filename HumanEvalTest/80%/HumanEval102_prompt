def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to find the largest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive.
2. If x > y, there are no numbers in the range, so return -1.
3. If there are numbers in the range, we should look for the largest even number.
4. If no even number exists in the range, return -1.

Approach:
- First, check if x > y -> return -1.
- We want the largest number in the range, so we should start from y and go backwards to x.
- For each number from y down to x, check if it is even.
- The first even number we find (which will be the largest) should be returned.
- If we don't find any even number in the entire range, return -1.

Alternatively, we can compute:
- The largest number in the range is y.
- If y is even, then it is the answer.
- If y is odd, then y-1 is the next candidate (if it is >= x).
- If y is odd and y-1 < x, then there is no even number in the range.

So we can do:
1. If x > y: return -1
2. If y is even: return y
3. Else (y is odd): 
   - candidate = y - 1
   - if candidate >= x: return candidate
   - else: return -1

This handles all cases efficiently.

Let's test with examples:
- choose_num(12,15): y=15 is odd -> candidate=14, which is >=12 -> return 14. Correct.
- choose_num(13,12): x=13 > y=12 -> return -1. Correct.

Another test: choose_num(3,5): 
y=5 is odd -> candidate=4, which is >=3 -> return 4. Correct.

Test: choose_num(3,3): 
y=3 is odd -> candidate=2, which is <3 -> return -1. Correct? But wait, 3 is odd and there is no even number in [3,3] so indeed -1.

Test: choose_num(2,2): 
y=2 is even -> return 2. Correct.

So the logic is sound.

Now we code accordingly.
```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y an
