The following is chain of thought:
To implement this function, we need to:
1. Check if n is a prime number
2. Return x if n is prime, otherwise return y

Steps for prime check:
- If n <= 1, it's not prime
- Check divisibility from 2 to sqrt(n) (inclusive)
- If any number divides n, it's not prime
- Otherwise, it's prime

Let's implement accordingly.

Note: Special cases for n=2 (prime) and even numbers >2 (not prime) can be handled efficiently.
We'll write an optimized prime check function.
