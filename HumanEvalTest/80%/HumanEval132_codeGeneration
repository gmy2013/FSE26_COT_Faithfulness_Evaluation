CodeGeneration:
Looking at the problem and the examples, I can see that the key insight is correct: we need to check if the string contains the subsequence "[ [ ] ]" (two opening brackets followed by two closing brackets in that order). This pattern represents the minimal nested structure where one bracket is nested inside another.

Here's the efficient implementation:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

    is_nested('[[]]') ➞ True
    is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[][]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[[][]]') ➞ True
    is_nested('[[]][[') ➞ True
    '''
    # We're looking for the pattern: '[', '[', ']', ']' in order
    pattern = ['[', '[', ']', ']']
    pattern_index = 0
    
    for char in string:
        if pattern_index < len(pattern) and char == pattern[pattern_index]:
            pattern_index += 1
            if pattern_index == len(pattern):
                return True
    
    return False
```

This solution works by:
1. Defining the target pattern we're looking for: two opening brackets followed by two closing brackets
2. Iterating through the string character by character
3. Trying to match the pattern in sequence
4. Returning True as soon as we find the complete pattern
5. Returning False if we reach the end without finding the pattern

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, and space complexity is O(1), making it very efficient.

Let's verify with the test cases:
- `[[]]` → matches the pattern exactly
- `[]]]]]]][[[[[]` → cannot find two '[' before two ']'
- `[][]` → has the pattern but not in the right order (opens, closes, opens, closes)
- `[]` → too short
- `[[][]]` → contains the pattern (first two '[', then the two ']' at the end)
- `[[]][[` → contains the pattern (first two '[', then the first two ']')
