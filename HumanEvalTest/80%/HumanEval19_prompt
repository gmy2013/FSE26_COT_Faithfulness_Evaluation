def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """ Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.

    'one three five'
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a string of space-delimited number words. We need to sort them by their numerical value and return as a space-delimited string.

Steps:
1. Split the input string into a list of words.
2. Create a mapping from word to numerical value (e.g., 'zero' -> 0, 'one' -> 1, ...).
3. Sort the list of words based on their numerical values.
4. Join the sorted list back into a string with spaces.
5. Return the result.

Let's implement accordingly.
```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    number_map = {
        'zero': 0,
        'one': 1,
        'two': 2,
        'three': 3,
        'four': 4,
        'five': 5,
        'six': 6,
        'seven': 7,
