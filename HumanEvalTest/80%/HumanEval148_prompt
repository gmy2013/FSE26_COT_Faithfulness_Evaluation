def bf(planet1, planet2):
    '''
    There are eight planets in our solar system: the closerst to the Sun 
    is Mercury, the next one is Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, 
    Uranus, Neptune.
    Write a function that takes two planet names as strings planet1 and planet2. 
    The function should return a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are 
    located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by 
    the proximity to the sun. 
    The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2
    are not correct planet names. 
    Examples
    bf("Jupiter", "Neptune") ==> ("Saturn", "Uranus")
    bf("Earth", "Mercury") ==> ("Venus")
    bf("Mercury", "Uranus") ==> ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
    '''

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:

1. We have eight planets in order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
2. We need to validate both input planet names - if either is not in this list, return empty tuple.
3. We need to find all planets between the two given planets (exclusive of the endpoints).
4. The order should be from closest to the sun to farthest.
5. We need to handle cases where planet1 might be closer or farther than planet2.

Plan:
1. Create the ordered list of planets.
2. Check if both planets are in this list. If not, return ().
3. Find the indices of both planets in the list.
4. Determine the start and end indices (min and max of the two indices).
5. Extract the planets between these indices (from start+1 to end).
6. Return as a tuple.

Let's implement accordingly.
