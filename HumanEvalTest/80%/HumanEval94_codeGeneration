CodeGeneration:
o iterate through each digit, convert each back to an integer, and sum them up.

Let's implement this step by step.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.

    Examples:
    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10
    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13
    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11
    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3
    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7
    """
    # Find all prime numbers in the list
    primes = [num for num in lst if is_prime(num)]
    
    # If no primes found, return 0
    if not primes:
        return 0
    
    # Find the largest prime
    largest_prime = max(primes)
    
    # Calculate the sum of digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(largest_prime))
    
    return digit_sum
```

This implementation:
1. Uses a helper function `is_prime()` to check for prime numbers
2. Filters the input list to get only prime numbers
3. Finds the maximum prime value
4. Converts the largest prime to a string and sums its digits
5. Returns the sum of digits

The solution handles edge cases where there might be no prime numbers in the list by returning 0.
