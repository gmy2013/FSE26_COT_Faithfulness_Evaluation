CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the chain of thought:

```python
def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """
    result = []
    fact = 1
    triangular = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        triangular += i
        fact *= i
        
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(fact)
        else:
            result.append(triangular)
    
    return result
```

This implementation efficiently computes the values by maintaining running totals for both factorial and triangular numbers, then selects the appropriate value based on whether the current index is even or odd. The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n) for the result list.
