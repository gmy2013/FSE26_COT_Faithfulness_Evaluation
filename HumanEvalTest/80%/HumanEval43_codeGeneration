CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the chain of thought:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])
    True
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    """
    if len(l) < 2:
        return False
        
    seen = set()
    
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    
    return False
```

This implementation:
1. First checks if the list has fewer than 2 elements and returns False immediately
2. Uses a set to track numbers we've seen for efficient O(1) lookups
3. For each number, checks if its negative counterpart exists in the set
4. Returns True immediately when a valid pair is found
5. Returns False if no valid pair is found after processing all elements

The algorithm handles all the test cases correctly and has optimal time and space complexity.
