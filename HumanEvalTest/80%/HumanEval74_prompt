def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    '''
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has 
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.

    Examples
    total_match([], []) ➞ []
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
    total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) ➞ ['4']
    '''

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to calculate the total number of characters in all strings for each list.
2. Compare the two totals:
   - If list1 has fewer total characters, return list1.
   - If list2 has fewer total characters, return list2.
   - If they have the same total, return list1 (the first list).
3. We need to handle empty lists correctly.

Steps to implement:
- Calculate total chars for lst1: sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
- Calculate total chars fo
