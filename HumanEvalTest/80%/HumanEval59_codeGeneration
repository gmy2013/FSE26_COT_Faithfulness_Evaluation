CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the chain of thought:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    largest = 1
    
    # Handle factor 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        largest = 2
        n //= 2
    
    # Handle odd factors starting from 3
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            largest = factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 2
    
    # If remaining n is greater than 1, it's prime
    if n > 1:
        largest = n
    
    return largest
```

This implementation follows the described approach:
1. First handles the factor 2 (the only even prime)
2. Then checks odd factors from 3 upwards
3. For each factor found, it divides n completely by that factor
4. Finally, if n > 1 after checking all factors up to âˆšn, the remaining n is prime and becomes the largest factor

The algorithm efficiently finds the largest prime factor by systematically dividing out all smaller factors first.
