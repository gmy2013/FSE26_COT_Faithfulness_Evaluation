CodeGeneration:
split by both commas and spaces using a regular expression, but the problem is simple enough without regex.

Let's implement the approach described:

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces to unify separators
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split by spaces (handles multiple spaces and removes empty strings)
    return s.split()
```
