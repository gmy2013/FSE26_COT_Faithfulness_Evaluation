    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a positive integer n. We need to compute the product of its odd digits.
 Steps:
 1. Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit.
 2. Initialize a product variable to 1 (since we are multiplying).
 3. For each digit in the string:
    - Convert the digit back to an integer.
    - Check if it is odd (using modulo 2 != 0).
    - If odd, multiply it with the current product.
 4. If no odd digits are found (i.e., product remains 1 and we didn't multiply any odd digit), return 0.
 However, note: if we start with product=1 and we never multiply (because all digits are even), we should return 0.
 But what if there is an odd digit? Then we multiply and the product becomes at least 1 (if the first odd digit is 1) or more.
 But consider: if the number has only one digit which is odd (say 1), then product=1. So we cannot rely on product being 1 to mean no odd digits.
 Alternatively, we can use a flag to check if we found at least one odd digit. But we can also do:
   If we never multiply (so product remains 1) and we did not process any odd digit? Actually, we can check if we found at least one odd digit.

 Another approach: 
   Instead, we can initialize product to 1 and then if we find any odd digit, we multiply. Then at the end, if we never multiplied (so product is still 1) and there were digits (so n>=1) but all even, then return 0.
   However, what if n=0? But the problem says positive integer, so n>=1.

 But note: if n has digits and we multiply at least once, then product will change. So we can check if product is still 1? But what if the only odd digit is 1? Then product remains 1. So we cannot distinguish between having a single odd digit 1 and having no odd digits.

 Therefore, we should use a flag to track if we found at least one odd digit.

 Alternatively, we can initialize product to 0 and then change it to 1 when we find the first odd digit. Then multiply subsequent odd digits. If we never set it to 1 (so it remains 0), we return 0.

 Steps with flag:
   found_odd = False
   product = 1
   for each digit:
        d = int(digit)
        if d % 2 != 0:
            product *= d
            found_odd = True
   if found_odd:
        return product
   else:
        return 0

 But we can also do without a flag by initializing product to 0 and then:
   for each digit:
        d = int(digit)
        if d % 2 != 0:
            if product == 0:
                product = 1   # start the product
            product *= d

   Then return product (if no odd digits, product remains 0).

 However, the problem says "return 0 if all digits are even". So we can use:

   product = 0
   for digit in str(n):
        d = int(digit)
        if d % 2 == 1:
            if product == 0:
                product = 1
            product *= d

   return product

 This works because:
   - Initially product=0.
   - When we find the first odd digit, we set product to 1 and then multiply by that digit. So for the first odd digit d, product becomes 1*d = d.
   - For subsequent odd digits, we multiply.
   - If we never find an odd digit, product remains 0.

 Let's test with examples:
   n=1: digit '1' is odd -> set product to 1 then multiply by 1 -> product=1 -> return 1.
   n=4: digit '4' is even -> skip -> product remains 0 -> r
