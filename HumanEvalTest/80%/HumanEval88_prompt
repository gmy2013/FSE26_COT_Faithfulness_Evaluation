    """
    Given an array of non-negative integers, return a copy of the given array after sorting,
    you will sort the given array in ascending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is odd,
    or sort it in descending order if the sum( first index value, last index value) is even.

    Note:
    * don't change the given array.

    Examples:
    * sort_array([]) => []
    * sort_array([5]) => [5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5]) => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    * sort_array([2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5, 6]) => [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if the array is empty. If so, return an empty list.
2. Check the length of the array. If it has only one element, return a copy of the array.
3. For arrays with at least two elements:
   - Calculate the sum of the first and last elements.
   - Determine if this sum is odd or even.
4. If the sum is odd, sort the array in ascending order.
5. If the sum is even, sort
