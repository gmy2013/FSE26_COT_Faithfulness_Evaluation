CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the approach:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True
    """
    # Handle edge case where b is empty string
    if not b:
        return True
    
    n = len(b)
    # Generate all rotations of b
    for i in range(n):
        rotation = b[i:] + b[:i]
        # Check if this rotation is a substring of a
        if rotation in a:
            return True
    return False
```

This implementation:
1. First handles the edge case where `b` is an empty string (returns True)
2. Generates all possible rotations of the second word `b` by slicing and concatenating
3. Checks each rotation to see if it exists as a substring in the first word `a`
4. Returns True immediately if any rotation is found, False if none are found

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) where n is the length of `b`, since we generate n rotations and each substring check is O(n) in the worst case.
