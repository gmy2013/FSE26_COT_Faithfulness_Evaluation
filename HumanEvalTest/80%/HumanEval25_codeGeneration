CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the `factorize` function:

```python
from typing import List


def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
    if n == 1:
        return []
    
    factors = []
    
    # Factor out all 2s
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    
    # Factor out odd numbers starting from 3
    i = 3
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
        i += 2
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, it's a prime number
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```

This implementation:
1. Handles the edge case where n = 1 by returning an empty list
2. First factors out all 2s (the only even prime)
3. Then factors out odd numbers starting from 3, incrementing by 2
4. Uses the optimization that we only need to check up to âˆšn
5. If n is still greater than 1 after all factors are found, it means n itself is prime
6. Returns the list of factors in ascending order with proper multiplicity

The function correctly handles all the test cases:
- factorize(8) = [2, 2, 2]
- factorize(25) = [5, 5] 
- factorize(70) = [2, 5, 7]
