    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:

1. We are allowed to perform only right shift operations (any number of times).
2. Each right shift moves every element one step to the right, with the last element wrapping around to the front.
3. We need to check if there exists some number of shifts (k) such that the shifted array is non-decreasing.
4. Since the array has unique elements, the sorted array is strictly increasing.

Observation:
- After k right shifts, the array becomes: [arr[n-k], arr[n-k+1], ..., arr[n-1], arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[n-k-1]]
- Essentially, we are rotating the array to the right by k positions.
- So the problem reduces to: is the array a rotation of a sorted array?

Approach:
1. If the array is empty, return True.
2. Find the minimum element in the array (since elements are unique, there is only one minimum).
3. The sorted array should start from the minimum element and be strictly increasing (since unique).
4. However, we must consider that the array might be rotated. So we can:
   - Locate the index of the minimum element. This is the point where the sorted sequence should start.
   - Check if from that index to the end, and then from the start to that index-1, the sequence is strictly increasing.
   - But note: after rotation, the entire array should be sorted. So we can simulate the rotated array and check if it is sorted.

Alternatively, we can:
- Without actually rotating, we can traverse the array and check for the number of "dips" (where arr[i] > arr[i+1]).
- In a sorted array that is rotated, there should be exactly one dip: when we wrap around from the end to the beginning.
- Specifically, if the array is sorted (non-decreasing) after rotation, then when we traverse the circular array, there should be at most one index i such that arr[i] > arr[(i+1) % n].

Steps:
1. Let n = len(arr). If n <= 1, return True.
2. Count the number of indices i (from 0 to n-1) where arr[i] > arr[(i+1) % n].
   - Why modulo? To check the wrap-around from last to first.
3. If the number of such dips is 0, the array is already sorted.
4. If there is exactly one dip, then it is possible to rotate to get sorted array.
   - For example, in [3,4,5,1,2]: the dip is at index 2 (5>1) and also we need to check the wrap-around: last element (2) and first (3): 2 < 3, so no dip there. So only one dip.
5. But wait: what if the array is not rotated sorted? For example [3,5,4,1,2]:
   - Check dips: 
        index0: 3>5? no
        index1: 5>4? yes -> dip1
        index2: 4>1? yes -> dip2
        index3: 1>2? no
        wrap: last (2) and first (3): 2<3 -> no dip.
   So two dips -> not sorted after any rotation.

Therefore, the condition is: if the number of dips is exactly 0 or 1, return True; otherwise False.

But note: if the array is already sorted (0 dips), it is valid. Also, if there is exactly one dip, it means we can rotate to make it sorted.

However, we must be cautious: the dip should occur only at the wrap-around point? Actually, in a rotated sorted array, the only dip should be at the point where the array wraps. So when we traverse, we should find exactly one dip.

So code:
dips = 0
n = len(arr)
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > arr[(i+1) % n]:
        dips += 1
    if dips > 1:
        return False
return True

But wait: what if the array has d
