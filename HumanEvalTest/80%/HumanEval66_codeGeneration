CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function based on the requirements:

```python
def digitSum(s):
    """Task
    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'
    ASCII codes.

    Examples:
        digitSum("") => 0
        digitSum("abAB") => 131
        digitSum("abcCd") => 67
        digitSum("helloE") => 69
        digitSum("woArBld") => 131
        digitSum("aAaaaXa") => 153
    """
    total = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            total += ord(char)
    return total
```

The function works as follows:
- Initializes `total` to 0 to accumulate the sum
- Iterates through each character in the input string
- Uses `char.isupper()` to check if the character is uppercase
- If uppercase, adds its ASCII value (obtained with `ord(char)`) to the total
- Returns the final sum after processing all characters

This handles the empty string case correctly (returns 0) and only considers uppercase characters as specified.
