def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''

The following is chain of thought:
To determine if a triangle is right-angled, we need to check if the square of the longest side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (Pythagorean theorem). Steps:
1. Identify the longest side among a, b, c.
2. Check if the square of the longest side equals the sum of squares of the other two sides.
3. Return True if it does, False otherwise.

We must also consider that the inputs could be in any order, so we need to sort them to find the largest.
Let's implement accordingly.
