CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function based on the requirements:

```python
def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    """
    # Check if the string contains any letters
    has_letters = any(char.isalpha() for char in s)
    
    if not has_letters:
        # Reverse the entire string if no letters
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        # Process each character: swap case for letters, keep others unchanged
        result = []
        for char in s:
            if char.isalpha():
                result.append(char.swapcase())
            else:
                result.append(char)
        return ''.join(result)
```

This implementation:
1. First checks if the string contains any letters using `any()` with `isalpha()`
2. If no letters are found, returns the reversed string using slicing `[::-1]`
3. If letters are present, iterates through each character and applies `swapcase()` to letters while keeping non-letters unchanged
4. Uses a list to build the result efficiently and joins it at the end

The function handles all the test cases correctly:
- `solve("1234")` returns `"4321"` (no letters, so reversed)
- `solve("ab")` returns `"AB"` (letters swapped case)
- `solve("#a@C")` returns `"#A@c"` (letters swapped case, non-letters unchanged)
