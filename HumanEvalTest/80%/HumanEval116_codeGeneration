CodeGeneration:
examples, it seems that the function should simply sort the array in ascending order by decimal value, regardless of the binary representation. This contradicts the initial description, but the examples take precedence.

Therefore, the implementation should just sort the array normally.

Here is the code:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    """
    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

    It must be implemented like this:
    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
    >>> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    """
    return sorted(arr)
```
