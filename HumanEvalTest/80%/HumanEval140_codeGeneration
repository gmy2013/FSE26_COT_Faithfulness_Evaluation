CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function using the algorithm described in the chain of thought:

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, 
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, 
    then replace all consecutive spaces with - 
    
    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    """
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(text)
    
    while i < n:
        if text[i] != ' ':
            result.append(text[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            count = 0
            j = i
            while j < n and text[j] == ' ':
                count += 1
                j += 1
            if count > 2:
                result.append('-')
            else:
                result.append('_' * count)
            i = j
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

This implementation:
1. Iterates through the string character by character
2. When it encounters a non-space character, it adds it directly to the result
3. When it encounters a space, it counts all consecutive spaces
4. If there are more than 2 consecutive spaces, it adds a single '-'
5. If there are 1-2 consecutive spaces, it adds the same number of '_' characters
6. Skips over the entire group of spaces after processing them

The algorithm efficiently handles all the test cases mentioned in the docstring.
