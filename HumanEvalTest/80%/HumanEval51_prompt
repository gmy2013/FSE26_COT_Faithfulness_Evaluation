The following is chain of thought:
We are removing vowels from the input string. Vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in both lowercase and uppercase.
 We can iterate through each character in the string and only keep those that are not vowels.
 We can create a string of vowels to check against, and build a new string without the vowel characters.

 Steps:
 1. Define what vowels are (both lowercase and uppercase).
 2. Initialize an empty string for the result.
 3. Loop through each character in the input text.
 4. If the character is not a vowel, add it to the result string.
 5. Return the result string.

 Alternatively, we can use a string translation or a list comprehension for efficiency.
