The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a valid subsequence of square brackets in the input string where at least one bracket is nested. A nested bracket means there is an opening bracket that is closed only after one or more pairs of brackets have been opened and closed in between. Essentially, we are looking for a pattern like "[ ... ]" where the inner brackets form a valid subsequence and there is at least one pair inside another.

Approach:
1. We are only dealing with '[' and ']'.
2. We need to check for a valid subsequence that has nesting. This implies we are looking for at least one occurrence of an opening bracket that is followed by a valid subsequence and then closed.
3. Instead of checking all subsequences, we can use a greedy method with a stack to simulate the matching of brackets.
4. However, note that we are not required to check if the entire string is valid. We only need to know if there exists any valid subsequence that has nesting.
5. The key insight: Nesting occurs if we have an opening bracket that is closed only after at least one other pair has been opened and closed. In other words, we need to find a pattern like "[ ... ]" where the inner "..." forms at least one complete pair.
6. We can traverse the string and use a stack to keep track of the indices of opening brackets. When we find a closing bracket, we pop the last opening bracket. The depth of nesting at that point can be calculated.
7. But note: we are not required to find the maximum nesting depth. We only need to know if there is any nesting at all in any valid subsequence.
8. Actually, the problem is equivalent to: does there exist a valid subsequence (which is a balanced bracket string) that has a nesting depth of at least 2? Because nesting depth 1 means no nesting (e.g., "[]" has depth 1, which is not nested). So we need depth >=2.
9. However, we are allowed to skip brackets arbitrarily to form the subsequence. So we can choose which brackets to include.
10. Therefore, the problem reduces to: can we select a subsequence of brackets that is balanced and has at least one pair inside another?
11. Another insight: we can always form a valid subsequence by taking matching pairs. But to have nesting, we need to have an opening bracket that is matched with a closing bracket that comes after at least one other complete pair.
12. How to check without generating all subsequences?
13. We can do:
    - Initialize a stack.
    - Traverse the string.
    - For each '[' push it to the stack.
    - For each ']', if the stack is not empty, pop one. This forms a matching pair.
    - But we need to know if during the popping, there was at least one time when the stack had at least one element after popping? Actually, when we pop, if the stack is not empty after popping, it means that the current pair is nested inside another. Because the stack contains the unmatched opening brackets. So if after popping we still have an opening bracket in the stack, that means the current pair is inside that outer one.
    - However, we are allowed to skip brackets. So we can choose to form the subsequence in a way that creates nesting.
14. Actually, we can use the following efficient method:
    - Let depth = 0.
    - For each char in string:
        if char is '[', depth += 1.
        if char is ']' and depth > 0, depth -= 1.
        But we are not forced to use every bracket. We can skip arbitrarily.
    - But we want to know if we can form a subsequence that has nesting.
15. Actually, the problem is known: it is equivalent to checking if the string contains the pattern "[ [] ]" as a subsequence? Not exactly, because we can have multiple pairs inside.

16. Insight from examples: 
    - "[[]]" returns True: because we have the outer brackets and inside one pair.
    - "[]]]]]]][[[[[]" returns False: because we cannot form a nested subsequence.
    - "[][]" returns False: because the pairs are adjacent, not nested.
    - "[]" returns False.
    - "[[][]]" returns True: because we can take the first '[', then the next '[', then the first ']' (which closes the inner), then the next ']' (which closes the outer). So we have nesting.
    - "[[]][[" returns True: we can form "[[]]" from the first part.

17. How about we try to find two overlapping pairs? Specifically, we need an opening bracket i, then an opening bracket j>i, then a closing bracket k that closes j, then a closing bracket l that closes i, with i < j < k < l.
    This is the necessary and sufficient condition for nesting: there exists indices i, j, k, l such that:
        i < j < k < l,
        string[i] = '[', string[j] = '[', string[k] = ']', string[l] = ']',
        and we can form a valid subsequence by including these and skipping others appropriately.

18. So the problem reduces to: does there exist indices i, j, k, l with i<j<k<l such that:
        s[i] = '[', s[j] = '[', s[k] = ']', s[l] = ']'
    Why? Because we can form the subsequence: s[i], s[j], s[k], s[l] which is "[ [] ]", which is a valid nested structure.

19. This is correct because:
    - The outer pair is i and l.
    - The inner pair is j and k.
    - And we have i<j<k<l.

20. Therefore, we can solve by:
    - Finding the first opening bracket i.
    - Then finding an opening bracket j after i.
    - Then finding a closing bracket k after j.
    - Then finding a closing bracket l after k.
    - If such sequence exists, return True.

21. We can do this efficiently by:
    - Precompute the positions of all opening brackets and closing brackets.
    - But we don't need to precompute all. We can do in one pass.

22. Algorithm:
    - Let first_open = -1, second_open = -1, first_close = -1, second_close = -1.
    - Actually, we need to find any i, j, k, l in order.
    - We can do:
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '[':
                for j in range(i+1, n):
                    if s[j] == '[':
                        for k in range(j+1, n):
                            if s[k] == ']':
                                for l in range(k+1, n):
                                    if s[l] == ']':
                                        return True
        return False

23. But this is O(n^4) which might be inefficient for long strings. However, the problem does not specify string length. But we can optimize.

24. We can optimize by:
    - Instead of nested loops, we can use:
        - Find the first opening bracket i.
        - Find the next opening bracket j after i.
        - Find the first closing bracket k after j.
        - Find the next closing bracket l after k.
    - So for each i, we can try to find j, then k, then l.

25. Actually, we can do without nested loops by using pointers:
    - We can iterate and remember the first two opening brackets and then the first two closing brackets after that.
    - But we need to ensure the order.

26. Alternatively, we can:
    - Count the number of opening brackets we have encountered so far.
    - When we see a closing bracket, if we have at least two opening brackets before, and we have at least one more closing bracket after, then we can form nesting.

27. Actually, a simpler idea: we need to have at least two pairs of brackets that are interleaved. Specifically, we need two opening brackets before two closing brackets.

28. In fact, the condition is equivalent to: the string must contain the subsequence "[ [ ] ]". So we can check for that.

29. How to check for subsequence "[ [ ] ]":
    - We need to find four characters in order: '[', '[', ']', ']'.
    - So we can traverse and try to match this pattern.

30. Therefore, the function can be implemented by checking if the string contains the subsequence "[ [ ] ]".

31. Why is this sufficient?
    - Because if we can find indices i, j, k, l with i<j<k<l and s[i]='[', s[j]='[', s[k]=']', s[l]=']', then we can form the nested structure.
    - This is exactly what we need.

32. And is it necessary?
    - Yes, because any nested structure must have an outer pair and an inner pair. The inner pair must be entirely inside the outer. So the outer opening must come before the inner opening, which comes before the inner closing, which comes before the outer closing.

33. Therefore, we can write:
    target = ['[', '[', ']', ']']
    index = 0
    for char in string:
        if index < 4 and char == target[index]:
            index += 1
    return index == 4

34. Let's test with examples:
    "[[]]": has the subsequence: first '[', second '[', first ']', second ']' -> matches.
    "[]]]]]]][[[[[]": we need to find two '[' then two ']'. The opening brackets are at the end. So we can't find two '[' before two ']'. Actually, we have many ']' first. So we might not match.
    But wait: we can skip brackets arbitrarily. So we can take the last two '[' and then two ']' after? But the ']' are before the '['? Actually, the string has closing brackets first then opening. So we cannot have an opening after a closing in the subsequence for the inner pair? Actually, for the subsequence, the order must be preserved. So we cannot take a '[' that comes after a ']' and use it as the inner opening if we have already taken the inner closing from before.

35. Actually, the subsequence must respect the original order. So if we have closing brackets before opening brackets, we cannot use them for the inner pair if the inner opening is after.

36. So the method with the pattern "[ [ ] ]" is correct.

37. Therefore, the code is:

    def is_nested(string):
        pattern = "[[]]"   # actually we need four characters: '[', '[', ']', ']'
        index = 0
        for char in string:
            if index == 0 and char == '[':
                index = 1
            elif index == 1 and char == '[':
                index = 2
            elif index == 2 and char == ']':
                index = 3
            elif index == 3 and char == ']':
                return True
        return False

38. But wait, we can also have more than two opening brackets. So we don't need to exactly match the first two. We can have multiple openings.

39. Actually, the pattern matching can be generalized: we are looking for four characters in order: two '[' then two ']'. So we can do:

    count_open = 0
    count_close = 0
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            count_open += 1
        else: # char is ']'
            if count_open >= 2:
                count_close += 1
                if count_close >= 2:
                    return True
    return False

40. But this is not exactly correct because the closing brackets must come after the two openings. So we need to have at least two openings before we start counting closings.

41. Actually, we can do:

    step = 0   # we need to fin
