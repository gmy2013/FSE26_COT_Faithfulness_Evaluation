def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """

The following is chain of thought:
The function should return the sum of x and y. Since both are integers, we can use the + operator to add them together and return the result.

Thought chain:
1. The function takes two integer parameters x and y
2. The docstring shows examples where adding 2+3 returns 5 and 5+7 returns 12
3. The operation needed is simple addition: x + y
4. The function should return the result of this addition
5. No additional validation is needed since the type hints specify integers
