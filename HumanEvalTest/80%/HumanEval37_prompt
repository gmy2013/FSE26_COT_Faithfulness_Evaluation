The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to create a new list that is identical to the input list at odd indices, but has the values at even indices sorted in ascending order. The indices are 0-indexed, meaning the first element (index 0) is even, the second (index 1) is odd, and so on.

**Chain of Thought:**
1. Extract the values at even indices from the original list.
2. Sort these extracted values.
3. Create a new list where we place the sorted values back into the even indices, while keeping the values at odd indices unchanged from the original list.
4. Return the new list.

**Implementation:**
- We can use list slicing with step 2 to get all even-indexed elements.
- Sort this list of even-indexed elements.
- Iterate over the original list and for each even index, take the next value from the sorted list, and for each odd index, take the value from the original list.

Alternatively, we can create a copy of the original list and then replace the even indices with the sorted values. This is efficient and straightforward.

Let's code accordingly:
```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    # Extract even indices values and sort them
    even_vals = sorted(l[::2])
    # Create a new list by iterating and replacing even indices with sorted values
    result = []
