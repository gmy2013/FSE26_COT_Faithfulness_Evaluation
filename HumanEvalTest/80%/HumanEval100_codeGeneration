CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    pile = []
    current = n
    for i in range(n):
        pile.append(current)
        current += 2
    return pile
```

This implementation:
1. Creates an empty list to store the stone counts
2. Starts with the initial value `n`
3. Iterates `n` times to create `n` levels
4. For each iteration, adds the current stone count to the list
5. Increments by 2 to get the next number of the same parity (odd or even)
6. Returns the completed list

The function correctly handles both odd and even starting values by always adding 2, which preserves the parity and gives the next number of the same type (odd or even).
