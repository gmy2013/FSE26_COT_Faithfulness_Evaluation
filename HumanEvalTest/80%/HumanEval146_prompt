def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function needs to count numbers that are >10 and have both first and last digits odd.
2. For negative numbers, we need to consider the absolute value when checking digits.
3. Convert each number to string to access first and last digits easily.
4. Check if first and last digits (converted to integers) are odd (1,3,5,7,9).
5. Only count numbers that satisfy both conditions: >10 and odd first/last digits.

Let's implement:
- Initialize a counter
- Iterate through each number in nums
- If number <= 10, skip
- Convert number to absolute value then to string to handle n
