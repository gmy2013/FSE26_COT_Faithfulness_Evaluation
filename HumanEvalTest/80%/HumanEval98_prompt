    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function needs to count uppercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U) at even indices (0-indexed).
2. We'll iterate through the string, checking characters at even indices.
3. For each character at an even index, check if it's an uppercase vowel.
4. If it is, increment the count.
5. Return the total count.

Let's implement this step by step:
- Initialize a counter variable to 0.
- Iterate through the string with index using enumerate.
- Check if index is even (index % 2 ==
