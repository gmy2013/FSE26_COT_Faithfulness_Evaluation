The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to convert a given positive integer (between 1 and 1000) into its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. Roman numerals are represented using combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet. The basic symbols and their values are:
- I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, M = 1000.

The approach involves:
1. Defining mappings for the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units places.
2. Breaking the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units digits.
3. Converting each digit to its Roman numeral representation using the appropriate mapping for its place value.
4. Combining these representations and converting the entire string to lowercase.

We'll handle each digit separately:
- For thousands (1000): only up to 1000, so we only need to handle 1000 (which is "M").
- For hundreds: digits 0-9 mapped to Roman numerals (e.g., 0->"", 1->"C", 4->"CD", 9->"CM").
- For tens: digits 0-9 mapped (e.g., 0->"", 1->"X", 4->"XL", 9->"XC").
- For units: digits 0-9 mapped (e.g., 0->"", 1->"I", 4->"IV", 9->"IX").

We'll create helper mappings for each place value to avoid repetition and ensure correctness.

Let's code accordingly.
