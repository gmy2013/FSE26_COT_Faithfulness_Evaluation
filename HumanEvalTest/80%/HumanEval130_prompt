def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The function should return a list of the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
2. The sequence starts at index 0 (as shown in example: tri(3) returns [1, 3, 2, 8] which has 4 elements for n=3).
3. We need to handle both even and odd cases according to the recurrence.

However, note the docstring says:
- tri(1) = 3 (this is for n=1, which would be index 1 in the sequence)
- The example output for n=3 is [1, 3, 2, 8], meaning:
   index 0: 1
   index 1: 3
   index 2: 2
   index 3: 8

But the recurrence is defined for n (which appears to be the index in the sequence):
- For even n: tri(n) = 1 + n/2
- For odd n: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)

Wait, there's a problem: the recurrence for odd n depends on tri(n+1), which is not yet computed. This suggests we might need a different approach.

Looking at the example:
   tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
But tri(4) is defined as 1 + 4/2 = 3 (since 4 is even).

So to compute tri(3) (which is odd), we need tri(4). This means we cannot compute from low to high directly because we need a future value.

Alternatively, we might need to rearrange the recurrence for odd n:
   tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)
=> tri(n+1) = tri(n) - tri(n-1) - tri(n-2)

But this doesn't seem helpful because we're solving for tri(n).

Another idea: the recurrence for odd n might be intended to be:
   tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n-3)
but the example says tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4), which doesn't match.

Wait, let's read the docstring carefully: "tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd."

This is unusual because it depends on n+1. This suggests that the sequence might be defined for all non-negative integers, and we need to compute it in a way that handles this dependency.

Perhaps we can express the recurrence for odd n as:
   tri(n+1) = tri(n) - tri(n-1) - tri(n-2)   [for n odd?]

But let's look at the example computation:
   tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
   => 8 = 2 + 3 + tri(4) => tri(4)=3, which matches the even rule.

So for n=3 (odd), we use the recurrence that involves n+1=4.

This means that to compute an odd term, we need the next even term. But the even term is defined by a closed form: 1 + n/2.

So for an odd n, we can write:
   tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + (1 + (n+1)/2)   [because n+1 is even]

Let's verify with n=3:
   tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + (1 + (3+1)/2) = tri(2) + tri(1) + (1+2)= tri(2)+tri(1)+3 = 2+3+3=8, correct.

So the recurrence for odd n is actually:
   tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + (1 + (n+1)/2)

But wait, (n+1)/2 might not be integer if n is even? But here n is odd, so n+1 is even.

Therefore, we can define:
   if n is even: tri(n) = 1 + n/2
   if n is odd: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + (1 + (n+1)/2)

Now, we need to generate the sequence from index 0 to n.

Also, note the example output for n=3 includes tri(0)=1. How is tri(0) defined?
The docstring doesn't define tri(0), but the example output has it as 1.

Let's assume tri(0)=1. This is consistent because for n=0 (even): 1 + 0/2 = 1.

So we have:
   tri(0) = 1
   tri(1) = 3 (given)
   For n>=2:
        if n is even: tri(n) = 1 + n/2
        if n is odd: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + (1 + (n+1)/2)

But wait, let's check n=2 (even): tri(2)=1+2/2=2, correct.
n=3 (odd): tri(3)=tri(2)+tri(1)+(1+(3+1)/2)=2+3+3=8, correct.
n=4 (even): tri(4)=1+4/2=3, correct.

So the recurrence is clear.

Now, we can implement:

We need to return a list of the first n+1 terms: [tri(0), tri(1), ..., tri(n)]

Steps:
1. If n is 0, return [1]
2. If n>=1, we need to compute up to n.
3. Initialize a list with tri(0)=1.
4. For n=1, we have
