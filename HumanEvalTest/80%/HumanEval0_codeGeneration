CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    n = len(numbers)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

The implementation follows the chain of thought:
1. It iterates through all pairs of numbers using nested loops
2. The outer loop goes through each element (index i)
3. The inner loop goes through all subsequent elements (index j > i) to avoid duplicate comparisons
4. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference
5. If any difference is less than the threshold, it returns True immediately
6. If no close elements are found after checking all pairs, it returns False

The time complexity is O(nÂ²) where n is the length of the list, which is optimal for this problem as we need to check all possible pairs.
