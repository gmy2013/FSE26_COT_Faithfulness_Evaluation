The following is chain of thought:
We are calculating the area of a triangle given the side length (a) and the height (h).
 The formula for the area of a triangle is: (base * height) / 2.
 In this function, the side length (a) is the base, and (h) is the height.
 So, we compute: (a * h) / 2.
 We return the result as a float since division might result in a decimal.

 Steps:
 1. Multiply the base (a) by the height (h).
 2. Divide the product by 2.
 3. Return the res
