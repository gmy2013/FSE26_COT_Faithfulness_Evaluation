def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given three integers: number (already eaten), need (additional needed), remaining (available in stock).
 The goal is to compute:
   total_eaten = number + min(need, remaining)   [if we can't get all we need, we take all remaining]
   left_after = max(0, remaining - need)         [if we take more than need? Actually no: we take min(need, remaining)]
 But note: if need is greater than remaining, we eat all remaining, so left_after becomes 0.
 So:
   carrots_to_eat = min(need, remaining)
   total_eaten = number + carrots_to_eat
   left_after = remaining - carrots_to_eat

 However, we must ensure that left_after is non-negative (which it will be because we subtract at most remaining).

 Let's test with examples:
 Example 1: eat(5,6,10) -> carrots_to_eat = min(6,10)=6 -> total_eaten=5+6=11, left_after=10-6=4 -> [11,4] correct.
 Example 2: eat(4,8,9) -> min(8,9)=8 -> total=4+8=12, left=9-8=1 -> [12,1] correct.
 Example 3: eat(1,10,10) -> min(10,10)=10 -> total=1+10=11, left=10-10=0 -> [11,0] correct.
 Example 4: eat(2,11,5) -> min(11,5)=5 -> total=2+5=7, left=5-5=0 -
