    """Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:
    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.
    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to multiply the unit digits of two given integers. The unit digit is the last digit of the number. We can extract the unit digit of each number by taking the absolute value (to handle negative numbers) and then using modulo 10. Then, we multiply these two unit digits and return the result.

Steps:
1. Get the absolute value of each number to handle negative inputs.
2. Extract the unit digit of each number by computing the remainder when divided by 10.
3. Multiply the two unit digits.
4. Return the product.

This approach ensures that negative numbers are handled correctly
