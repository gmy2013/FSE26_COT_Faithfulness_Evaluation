     "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a list of strings `lst`, each string contains only digits.
 For each string in the list, we need to count the number of odd digits (i.e., digits that are 1,3,5,7,9).
 Then, we form a string: "the number of odd elements Xn the strXng X of the Xnput." 
 But note: in the example, the word "in" is replaced by "n", and the word "i" is replaced by the count? Actually, looking at the examples:

 Example 1: 
   Input: ['1234567'] -> there are 4 odd digits (1,3,5,7) -> output string replaces every occurrence of the letter 'i' with the number 4?
   But wait: the output is "the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput." 
   So indeed, we replace every 'i' in the base string with the count (which is 4). However, note that the word "in" becomes "4n", meaning we are replacing the letter 'i' regardless of context.

 Example 2:
   First string: '3' -> count=1 -> replace every 'i' with 1 -> "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput."
   Second string: '11111111' -> count=8 -> replace every 'i' with 8 -> "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."

 Therefore, for each string s in the input list:
   Step 1: Count the number of odd digits in s.
   Step 2: Create the base string: "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
   Step 3: Replace every occurrence of the letter 'i' in the base string with the count (converted to string).
   However, note: the base string has the word "in" which becomes "Xn", and "string" becomes "strXng", etc.

 But wait: the base string in the docstring is written with actual 'i's. So we can define a template:
   template = "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."

 Then, for a given count (say, n), we replace every 'i' in the template with the string representation of n.

 However, note: the example output does not have the word "in" but "4n", meaning we are replacing the letter 'i' even in the middle of words.

 So the plan is:
   For each string in the input list:
      count = number of odd digits in that string
      template = "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
      result_string = template.replace('i', str(count))

 But wait: what if the count has a digit 'i'? Actually, the count is a number, and we are replacing the letter 'i' with the string of the number. So if the count is 8, we replace every 'i' with '8'. This is straightforward.

 However, note: the example output for the first example has "4n" and "str4ng", which are exactly the replacements of the letter 'i' in "in" and "string".

 Therefore, we can proceed.

 Implementation:
   We'll iterate over each string in the input list.
   For a string s:
      count = 0
      for char in s:
          if int(char) % 2 == 1:  # because it's an odd digit
             count += 1
      template = "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
      output_string = template.replace('i', str(count))
      add output_string to the result list.

 But note: the template has multiple 'i's. The replace method will replace all of them.

 Let's test with the examples:

   Example 1: count=4 -> 
        template: "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
        replace every 'i' with '4': 
          becomes: "the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput." -> which matches.

   Example 2: first string: count=1 -> 
        becomes: "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput." -> matches.

   Second string: count=8 -> 
        becomes: "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput." -> matches.

 So the code is straightforward.

 However, note: the template string has a typo? It says "elements" in the docstring, but the example output says "elements" (correct) and the docstring of the function says "elements" as well. So we are good.

 Code:
   result = []
   for s in lst:
        count = 0
        for digit in s:
            if i
