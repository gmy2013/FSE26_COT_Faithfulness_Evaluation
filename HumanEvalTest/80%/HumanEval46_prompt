    """The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fib4(0) -> 0
    fib4(1) -> 0
    fib4(2) -> 2
    fib4(3) -> 0
    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.  Do not use recursion.
    >>> fib4(5)
    4
    >>> fib4(6)
    8
    >>> fib4(7)
    14

The following is chain of thought:
Looking at the problem, I need to implement an iterative solution for the fib4 sequence without recursion.

Chain of thought:
1. The fib4 sequence has base cases: n=0→0, n=1→0, n=2→2, n=3→0
2. For n≥4, fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)
3. Since recursion is not allowed, I'll use an iterative approach with a list to store previous values
4. I'll handle the base cases directly for n < 4
5. For n ≥ 4, I'll calculate values iteratively using the recurrence relation
6. I only need to keep the last 4 values to compute the next one

Implementation approach:
- Create a list to store the last 4 values
- Initialize with base cases: [0, 0, 2, 0] for n=0,1,2,3
- For n ≥ 4, iteratively calculate each new value as the sum of previous 4
- Update the list to maintain only the last 4 values

```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n < 4:
        return [0, 0, 2, 0][n]
