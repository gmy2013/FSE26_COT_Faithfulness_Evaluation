The following is chain of thought:
We are generating all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest.
 The prefixes are: first character, first two characters, ..., the entire string.
 We can achieve this by iterating from index 1 to len(string)+1 and taking slices.
 For each index i in range(1, len(string)+1), we take the slice string[0:i].
 Then we collect these slices in a list and return it.

 Let's code accordingly.
