The following is chain of thought:
To implement the `change_base` function, we need to convert the integer `x` to a string representation in the given `base`. Since bases are less than 10, we can use digits 0-9. The algorithm involves repeatedly dividing `x` by `base` and collecting the remainders, which form the digits of the result in reverse order.

1. Handle the case when `x` is 0: return "0".
2. Initialize an empty list to store digits.
3. While `x` is greater than 0:
   - Calculate the remainder when `x` is divided by `base`.
   - Append the remainder (as a string) to the list.
   - Update `x` to be the integer division of `x` by `base`.
4. The digits are collected
