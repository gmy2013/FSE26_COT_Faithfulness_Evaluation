    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to encrypt a string by rotating each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. The rotation is defined as shifting down by two multiplied by two places, which is equivalent to shifting by 4 positions (since 2 * 2 = 4). 

Steps:
1. Understand the rotation: Each letter should be replaced by the letter that is 4 positions ahead in the alphabet.
2. Handle wrapping: If shifting goes beyond 'z', it should wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet.
3. Process each character: For each character in the input string, if it is a lowercase letter, apply the shift; otherwise, leave it unchanged (though the examples only have lowercase, the function should be robust).
4. Build the result: Construct the encrypted string by processing each character.

Implementation:
- Use the `ord` function to get the Unicode code point of a character.
- For a lowercase letter, subtract the code of 'a' to get a position (0-25), add 4, take modulo 26 to handle wrapping, then add back 'a' to get the new character.
- Use `chr` to convert the code point back to a character.
- For non-lowercase letters, return the character as is.
