CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on your chain of thought:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    count = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            count += 1
        else:  # char == ')'
            count -= 1
        if count < 0:
            return False
    return count == 0
```

This implementation follows your algorithm exactly:
1. Initialize a counter to 0
2. For each character: increment for '(', decrement for ')'
3. Return False immediately if counter becomes negative (more closing than opening)
4. Return True only if counter ends at 0 (balanced)

The algorithm correctly handles all the test cases:
- "(" → count=1 → False
- "()" → count=1 then 0 → True
- "(()())" → properly balanced → True
- ")(()" → count becomes -1 immediately → False
