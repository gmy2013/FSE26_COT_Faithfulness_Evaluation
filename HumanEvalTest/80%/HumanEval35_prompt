def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Looking at the function requirements:
- Need to find the maximum element in a list
- The function should return a single value (the maximum)
- The examples show lists with both positive and negative numbers

Since this is a basic maximum finding operation, I can use Python's built-in max() function which efficiently finds the maximum value in an iterable.

The implementation is straightforward:
1. Use the max() function on the input list
2. Return the result

This will handle all cases including empty lists (though the examples don't show this edge case, max() will raise a ValueError for empty lists which is appropriate behavior).

```python
def max_element(l: list):
    """
