    Write a function count_nums which takes an array of integers and returns
    the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
    If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
    e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of elements in an array where the sum of the digits (considering the sign for negative numbers) is greater than zero. For negative numbers, the first digit (the most significant digit) is negative. For example
