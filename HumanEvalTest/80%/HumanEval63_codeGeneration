Here's the efficient implementation of the fibfib function:

```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    """The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
    >>> fibfib(1)
    0
    >>> fibfib(5)
    4
    >>> fibfib(8)
    24
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first three values
    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1  # fibfib(0), fibfib(1), fibfib(2)
    
    # Iterate from 3 to n
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        next_val = a + b + c
        # Update the three values for next iteration
        a, b, c = b, c, next_val
    
    return c
```

This implementation uses an iterative approach with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, making it efficient even for large values of n. The function handles the base cases directly and then iteratively computes the result using only three variables to track the necessary previous values.
