CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function based on the provided docstring and chain of thought:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

This implementation:
1. Initializes a counter `count` to 0
2. Iterates through all integers from 1 to n-1
3. Checks if each number is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator
4. For numbers that meet the divisibility condition, converts them to strings and counts occurrences of '7'
5. Accumulates the count of '7's across all qualifying numbers
6. Returns the total count

The function correctly handles the provided test cases:
- `fizz_buzz(50)` returns 0 (no numbers divisible by 11 or 13 contain '7')
- `fizz_buzz(78)` returns 2 (77 contains two '7's)
- `fizz_buzz(79)` returns 3 (77 contains two '7's and 78 doesn't contain '7')
