    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:

    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a non-empty list of integers.
 We need to add (sum) the even elements that are at odd indices.
 Steps:
 1. Iterate over the indices of the list.
 2. Check if the index is odd (i.e., index % 2 != 0).
 3. For elements at odd indices, check if the element is even (i.e., element % 2 == 0).
 4. If both conditions are true, add the element to the total.
 5. Return the total.

 Example: 
   For [4, 2, 6, 7]:
     Index 0 (even index) -> skip.
     Index 1 (odd index): element is 2 (even) -> add 2.
     Index 2 (even index) -> skip.
     Index 3 (odd index): element is 7 (odd) -> skip.
   Total = 2.

 Implementation:
   We can use a loop with enumerate to get both index and value.
   Initialize a variable (e.g., total) to 0.
