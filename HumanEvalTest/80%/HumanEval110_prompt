The following is chain of thought:
Let's analyze the problem:

We need to make all elements in lst1 even by swapping any number of elements between lst1 and lst2.

Key observations:
1. We can swap any number of elements between the two lists.
2. We only care about making all elements in lst1 even (lst2 can have any numbers).
3. The operation is essentially: we can replace any element in lst1 with any element from lst2.

Therefore:
- We need to have enough even numbers available overall to fill lst1.
- Specifically, the total number of even numbers in both lists must be at least the length of lst1.

Why?
- Initially, lst1 has some even numbers (which we can keep) and some odd numbers (which we need to replace with even numbers).
- We can take even numbers from lst2 to replace the odd numbers in lst1.
- But we might also swap an even number from lst1 with an odd number from lst2 (which would be counterproductive). However, we are allowed to do any number of swaps arbitrarily, so we can optimize.

Actually, the minimal requirement is:
Let:
  n = len(lst1)
  current_evens_in_lst1 = number of even numbers in lst1
  needed_evens = n - current_evens_in_lst1   [number of odd numbers in lst1 that need to be replaced]

We need to get these needed_evens even numbers from lst2. So the number of even numbers in lst2 must be at least needed_evens.

But wait: we can also swap an odd from lst1 with an even from lst2. That would be one beneficial swap. Alternatively, we might swap an even from lst1 with an odd from lst2? That would be bad. So we should avoid that.

Actually, the net effect is: we want to end up with n even numbers in lst1. The total number of even numbers in both lists is fixed. So if the total number of even numbers in both lists is at least n, then we can assign n even numbers to lst1.

Why is that sufficient?
- We can always arrange the swaps to put n even numbers in lst1 if there are at least n even numbers in total. For example, we can just swap each odd in lst1 with an even from lst2. If there are more than n even numbers, we have extras. If exactly n, we use all.

But what if there are less than n even numbers in total? Then it's impossible to have n even numbers in lst1.

Therefore, the condition is:
total_evens = (number of even numbers in lst1) + (number of even numbers in lst2)
if total_evens >= len(lst1):
    return "YES"
else:
    return "NO"

Let's test with examples:

Example 1: 
lst1 = [1,2,3,4], lst2 = [1,2,3,4]
