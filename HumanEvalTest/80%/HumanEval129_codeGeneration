CodeGeneration:
h is considered minimum based on lexicographical order of the sequence of values visited.

Approach:
1. Since k can be large and the grid has N*N cells, we need an efficient method.
2. Observation: The path of length k must start with the smallest possible value. However, because we can revisit cells, the optimal path might involve cycling between two low-value cells after an initial segment.
3. Key insight: For k=1, we simply take the smallest value in the grid. For k>1, the path will start with the smallest value, and then for subsequent steps, we want to choose the smallest possible neighbor at each step. However, if k is large, we might need to cycle between two cells with very small values to keep the sequence lexicographically smallest.
4. Actually, the problem states that the answer is unique. We can use dynamic programming or BFS? But k might be large (up to 50? Actually, the grid has N>=2 and k is positive, but no upper bound given. However, since we can revisit, the state is (cell, steps) but that would be O(N^2 * k) which might be acceptable if k is not too large? But wait, k can be very large? Actually, the problem does not specify an upper bound for k. However, note that the grid has distinct integers from 1 to N*N. So the number of distinct values is N*N.
5. Important: The lexicographic order means that the first element must be as small as possible. Then the second, and so on. So the first cell must be the smallest value in the grid. But wait: what if the smallest value has no small neighbors? Actually, we can always move to any neighbor. So the first value should be the absolute minimum value in the grid. Let min_val = min(min(row) for row in grid). The path must start at the cell with min_val.
6. However, after the start, we want the next value to be as small as possible. But note: we can revisit the same cell. So if the start cell has a neighbor that is even smaller? Actually, the start cell is the smallest, so all neighbors are larger. So the second value will be the smallest neighbor of the start cell.
7. For the third step: we can go back to the start cell (which is min_val) if that is allowed. So the sequence can be [min_val, neighbor, min_val, neighbor, ...] for k steps.
8. But is that always optimal? Consider: if there is a neighbor that is very small, but not as small as the start, and then from that neighbor we can go to an even smaller cell? Actually, the start is the smallest. So from the start, all neighbors are larger. So the best second step is the smallest neighbor. Then from that neighbor, the best next step is the smallest neighbor of that cell. However, that might be the start cell again (if it is adjacent). So indeed, after the first step, we might alternate between the start and its smallest neighbor.
9. However, what if the start cell has multiple neighbors? We should choose the smallest one for the second step. Then for the third step, from that neighbor, we can go back to the start (which is min_val) which is smaller than any other neighbor of the second cell. So the third step should be the start cell. Then the fourth step should be the same neighbor again? So the pattern is [min_val, a, min_val, a, ...] where a is the smallest neighbor of the start cell.
10. But what if the smallest neighbor of the start cell has a neighbor that is even smaller than the start? That cannot happen because the start is the smallest. So the pattern holds.
11. However, what if the start cell has no neighbor that is smaller than some other path? Actually, no, because the start is the smallest.
12. Therefore, the algorithm:
   - Find the cell with the minimum value. Let it be (i0, j0).
   - If k==1, return [grid[i0][j0]].
   - Find the smallest neighbor of (i0, j0). Let it be value 'a'.
   - Then the path will be: [min_val, a, min_val, a, ...] for k steps.
   - But wait: what if there is a tie in neighbors? For example, if the start cell has two neighbors with the same value? Then we need to look further? Actually, the problem says the answer is unique, so there should be no tie. But we should still choose the smallest.
13. However, consider the example: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k=3. Output is [1,2,1]. So indeed: start at 1, then go to 2 (smallest neighbor), then back to 1. So the pattern is [1,2,1].
14. But what if the start cell has multiple neighbors with the same value? Then we need to compare the subsequent steps. For instance, if two neighbors have the same value, then from each we can go to their neighbors. But since we can cycle, the best would be to choose the one that has the smallest neighbor in the next step? Actually, for the second step we only care about the value itself. So if there are two neighbors with the same value, it doesn't matter which we choose for the second step. Then for the third step, we can go back to the start. So the sequence would be the same.
15. Implementation:
   Step 1: Find the start cell (with min value).
   Step 2: If k==1, return [min_val].
   Step 3: Find the smallest neighbor of the start cell. Let it be 'a'.
   Step 4: Then the path is: [min_val] + [a, min_val] * ((k-1)//2) if (k-1) is even? Actually, for k=3: we have [min_val, a, min_val]. So the sequence has min_val at odd indices (1-indexed) and a at even indices.
   So the list: first element is min_val, then for the next (k-1) elements, we alternate between a and min_val.

16. However, what if k is even? For k=2: [min_val, a]. For k=4: [min_val, a, min_val, a].
17. So the code can be:
   result = [min_val]
   for i in range(1, k):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            result.append(a)
        else:
            result.append(min_val)
18. But wait: is this always optimal? What if the smallest neighbor 'a' has a neighbor that is even smaller than the start? That cannot happen. So it is safe.

19. However, consider a grid where the start cell is isolated? But the grid has at least 2x2, so every cell has at least two neighbors (except corners which have two). So we will always have a neighbor.

20. Therefore, we can implement as described.

Let's code accordingly.

Note: We need to find the smallest neighbor of the start cell. The neighbors are adjacent (up, down, left, right). We must not go out of bounds.

Implementation:

1. Find the minimum value and its coordinates.
2. If k==1, return [min_val].
3. Find all neighbors of the start cell (within bounds).
4. Among these neighbors, find the one with the smallest value.
5. Construct the path list by starting with min_val and then alternating between the neighbor value and min_val for the remaining k-1 steps.

Code:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    # Find the cell with the minimum value
    min_val = float('inf')
    i0, j0 = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] < min_val:
                min_val = grid[i][j]
                i0, j0 = i, j
    
    if k == 1:
        return [min_val]
    
    # Find the smallest neighbor of (i0, j0)
    neighbors = []
    directions = [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]
    for dx, dy in directions:
        ni, nj = i0 + dx, j0 + dy
        if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:
            neighbors.append(grid[ni][nj])
    
    a = min(neighbors)
    
    # Build the path
    path = [min_val]
    for i in range(1, k):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            path.append(a)
        else:
            path.append(min_val)
    
    return path
```

Let's test with the examples:

Example 1: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k=3.
   min_val = 1 at (0,0)
   Neighbors of (0,0): right (0,1)=2, down (1,0)=4. The smallest is 2.
   Path: [1, 2, 1] -> correct.

Example 2: grid = [[5,9,3],[4,1,6],[7,8,2]], k=1.
   min_val=1 at (1,1) -> returns [1] -> correct.

So the code should work.
```

Therefore, the complete function is:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    min_val = float('inf')
    i0, j0 = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] < min_val:
                min_val = grid[i][j]
                i0, j0 = i, j
                
    if k == 1:
        return [min_val]
        
    directions = [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]
    neighbors = []
    for dx, dy in directions:
        ni, nj = i0 + dx, j0 + dy
        if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:
            neighbors.append(grid[ni][nj])
            
    a = min(neighbors)
    path = [min_val]
    for i in range(1, k):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            path.append(a)
        else:
            path.append(min_val)
            
    return path
```
