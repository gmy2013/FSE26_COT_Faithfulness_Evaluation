CodeGeneration:
I'll implement the function based on the analysis. The key insight is that we need at least `len(lst1)` even numbers across both lists to make all elements in lst1 even.

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    """
    # Count even numbers in both lists
    evens_in_lst1 = sum(1 for num in lst1 if num % 2 == 0)
    evens_in_lst2 = sum(1 for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0)
    
    total_evens = evens_in_lst1 + evens_in_lst2
    
    # Check if we have enough even numbers to fill lst1
    if total_evens >= len(lst1):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

Let me verify with the provided examples:

1. `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])`:
   - lst1 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
   - lst2 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
   - Total evens = 4, len(lst1) = 4 → "YES" ✓

2. `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])`:
   - lst1 has 2 even numbers (2, 4)
   - lst2 has 1 even number (4)
   - Total evens = 3, len(lst1) = 4 → "NO" ✓

The implementation correctly handles both test cases.
