The following is chain of thought:
We are implementing a function to return the length of a string.
 Since Python has a built-in len() function, we can simply use that.
 However, the problem might be expecting a manual implementation for learning purposes.
 But the docstring examples are straightforward and match the behavior of len().
 Given the instructions, we should implement the function to return the length.
 The simplest and most
