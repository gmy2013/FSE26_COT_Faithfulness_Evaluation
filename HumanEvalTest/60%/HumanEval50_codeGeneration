CodeGeneration:
`(ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26` might be negative, we can add 26 before taking modulo to ensure it's positive, or use modulo arithmetic that handles negatives correctly.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26 + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

However, to handle negative values more explicitly, we can write it as:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    decoded = ""
    for ch in s:
        # Reverse the shift: subtract 5 instead of adding
        shifted = (ord(ch) - ord("a") - 5) % 26
        if shifted < 0:
            shifted += 26
        decoded_char = chr(shifted + ord("a"))
        decoded += decoded_char
    return decoded
```

But since Python's modulo operator handles negative numbers correctly (e.g., `-1 % 26 = 25`), the first implementation is sufficient and more concise.
