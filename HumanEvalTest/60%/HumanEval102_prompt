def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let me break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to find the largest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive
2. If no even number exists in this range, return -1
3. We need to handle cases where x and y might be in any order (but the problem says "positive numbers")
4. The range should be considered from min(x,y) to max(x,y) to handle cases like (13, 12)

Here's my approach:
1. First determine the actual start and end of our range
2. Find the largest even number ≤ y
3. Check if this number is ≥ x
4. If yes, return it; otherwise return -1

To find the largest even number ≤ y:
- If y is even, it's y itself
- If y is odd, it's y-1

Then we just need to check if this number is within our range [x, y].

Let me implement this:
```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and r
