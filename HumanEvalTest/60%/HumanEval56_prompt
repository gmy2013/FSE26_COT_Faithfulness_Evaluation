The following is chain of thought:
We are going to iterate through each character in the string.
 We can use a counter that starts at 0.
 For every opening bracket '<', we increment the counter.
 For every closing bracket '>', we decrement the counter.
 However, if the counter becomes negative at any point, that means we have a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so we return False.
 After processing all brackets, if the counter is exactly 0, then all brackets are matched. Otherwise, there are unmatched opening brackets.

 Steps:
 1. Initialize a balance counter to 0.
 2. For each char in the string:
      if char is '<', then increment balance by 1.
      if char is '>', then decrement balance by 1.
      if balance becomes negative at an
