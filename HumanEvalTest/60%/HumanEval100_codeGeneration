CodeGeneration:
Let's verify with the example: n=3 (odd)
   i=0: 3 + 2*0 = 3
   i=1: 3 + 2*1 = 5
   i=2: 3 + 2*2 = 7
   Result: [3,5,7] which matches.

 Similarly, if n=4 (even):
   i=0: 4
   i=1: 6
   i=2: 8
   i=3: 10
   So the list would be [4,6,8,10]. And indeed, 4 is even, next even is 6, then 8, then 10.

 So the solution is straightforward.

 Code implementation:
```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    return [n + 2 * i for i in range(n)]
```
