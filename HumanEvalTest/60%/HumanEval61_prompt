 We'll maintain a counter that starts at 0.
 For each opening bracket '(', we increment the counter.
 For each closing bracket ')', we decrement the counter.
 If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means we have more closing brackets than opening ones (which is invalid), so return False.
 After processing all brackets, if the counter is exactly 0, return True (all opened brackets were closed
