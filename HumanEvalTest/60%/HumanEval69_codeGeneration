CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the problem requirements:

```python
def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count frequency of each number
    freq = Counter(lst)
    
    # Find all numbers that satisfy the condition: frequency >= number
    candidates = [num for num in freq if num <= freq[num]]
    
    # Return the maximum candidate if any exist, otherwise return -1
    return max(candidates) if candidates else -1
```

Alternative implementation without using Counter (if you prefer to avoid imports):

```python
def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1
    '''
    # Count frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in lst:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Find the greatest number that satisfies the condition
    result = -1
    for num, count in freq.items():
        if num <= count and num > result:
            result = num
    
    return result
```

Both implementations will correctly solve the problem:
- First example: 2 appears twice, and 2 ≤ 2, so it's valid
- Second example: 3 appears three times, and 3 ≤ 3, so it's valid (and greater than 2)
- Third example: 5 appears twice (2 < 5), 4 appears three times (3 < 4), so no valid numbers
