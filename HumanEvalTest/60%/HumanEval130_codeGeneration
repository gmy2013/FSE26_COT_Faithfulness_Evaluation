CodeGeneration:
Based on the analysis, here's the implementation of the `tri` function:

```python
def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
    """
    if n < 0:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the result list with n+1 elements
    result = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Handle base cases
    if n >= 0:
        result[0] = 1  # From the example output
    
    if n >= 1:
        result[1] = 3  # Given: tri(1) = 3
    
    # Compute the sequence
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index
            result[i] = 1 + i // 2
        else:  # Odd index
            # tri(i) = tri(i-1) + tri(i-2) + 1 + (i+1)/2
            result[i] = result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + 1 + (i + 1) // 2
    
    return result
```

The implementation:
1. Starts with the base case `tri(0) = 1` (from the example output)
2. Uses the given `tri(1) = 3` 
3. For even indices, uses the direct formula `1 + n/2`
4. For odd indices, uses the derived formula `tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + 1 + (n+1)/2`
5. Returns a list of the first n+1 Tribonacci numbers

The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n) to store the result list.
