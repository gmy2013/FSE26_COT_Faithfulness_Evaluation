def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to convert a given decimal number to its binary representation and then wrap it with the characters 'db' at both the beginning and the end. The binary representation should be a string of '0's and '1's without any prefixes like '0b'. 

Approach:
1. Convert the decimal number to binary using built-in functions. In Python, `bin(decimal)` returns a string that starts with '0b' followed by the binary digits.
2. Remove the '0b
