The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to insert a delimiter between every two consecutive elements in the input list. The approach involves iterating through the list and building a new list that includes each original element followed by the delimiter, except for the last element which should not be followed by a delimiter.

Chain of thought:
1. If the input list is empty, return an empty list immediately.
2. Initialize an empty result list.
3. Iterate over each element in the input list except the last one.
   - Append the current element to the result list.
   - Append the delimiter to the result list.
4. After the loop, append the last element of
