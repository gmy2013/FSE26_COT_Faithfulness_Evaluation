CodeGeneration:
nt to shifting by 4 positions (since 2 * 2 = 4). We'll handle both lowercase and uppercase letters, but the examples only show lowercase, so we'll assume the input is lowercase for simplicity, but we can make it case-sensitive if needed. However, the examples don't include uppercase, so we'll implement for lowercase only.

Steps:
1. Define the shift amount: shift = 4 (because 2 * 2 = 4).
2. For each character in the string:
   - If it is a lowercase letter, shift it by 4 positions in the alphabet.
   - If it goes beyond 'z', wrap around to the beginning.
   - Non-alphabet characters should remain unchanged.
3. Return the encrypted string.

We can use the `ord` and `chr` functions to handle the shifting.

Let's implement accordingly.
```python
def encrypt(s):
    shift = 4  # because 2 multiplied by 2 is 4
    encrypted = []
    for char in s:
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
            # Shift the character by 4 positions
            new_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
            encrypted.append(new_char)
        else:
            # Non-lowercase letters are left unchanged
            encrypted.append(char)
    return ''.join(encrypted)
```
