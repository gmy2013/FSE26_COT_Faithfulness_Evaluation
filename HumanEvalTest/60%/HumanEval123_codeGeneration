CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
    """
    odd_list = []
    current = n
    
    while True:
        if current % 2 == 1:  # Check if current number is odd
            odd_list.append(current)
        if current == 1:  # Break when we reach 1
            break
        # Generate next term in Collatz sequence
        if current % 2 == 0:
            current = current // 2
        else:
            current = 3 * current + 1
    
    odd_list.sort()  # Sort the list in increasing order
    return odd_list
```

This implementation:
1. Initializes an empty list to collect odd numbers
2. Starts with the given number `n`
3. Uses a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence
4. Checks if each number is odd and adds it to the list
5. Breaks the loop when reaching 1
6. Sorts the final list of odd numbers in increasing order
7. Returns the sorted list

The function correctly handles the example case: `get_odd_collatz(5)` returns `[1, 5]` as expected.
