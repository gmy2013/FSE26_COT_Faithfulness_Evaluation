The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to create a new list that is identical to the original list at odd indices, but the values at even indices are sorted in ascending order. The indices are considered 0-based, meaning the first element (index 0) is even, the second (index 1) is odd, and so on.

Chain of thought:
1. Extract the values at even indices from the original list.
2. Sort these extracted values.
3. Create a new list where we place the sorted values back into the even indices, while keeping the values at odd indices unchanged from the original list.

Steps in code:
- We can create a list of even-indexed elements by slicing with step 2 (starting at index 0).
- Sort this list.
- Iterate over the original list and for each even index, take the next value from the sorted list (in order), and for each odd index, take the value from the original list.

Alternatively, we can:
- Make a copy of the original list to avoid mutation.
- Extract the even-indexed elemen
