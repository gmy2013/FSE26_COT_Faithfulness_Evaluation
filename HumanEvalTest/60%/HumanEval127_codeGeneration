To solve this problem, we need to determine if the length of the intersection of two closed intervals is a prime number. Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. **Find the intersection**:
   - The intersection of two intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] is [max(a1, a2), min(b1, b2)].
   - If the start of the intersection is greater than the end, there is no intersection.

2. **Calculate the length**:
   - For a closed interval [start, end], the length is (end - start + 1).

3. **Check if the length is prime**:
   - If the length is less than 2, it is not prime.
   - Check for divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.

4. **Return "YES" if prime, "NO" otherwise**.

Here is the code:

```python
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """
    a1, b1 = interval1
    a2, b2 = interval2
    
    start = max(a1, a2)
    end = min(b1, b2)
    
    if start > end:
        return "NO"
    
    length = end - start + 1
    
    if length < 2:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check for prime
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return "NO"
    
    return "YES"
```

This code first computes the intersection of the two intervals. If there is no intersection, it returns "NO". Then, it calculates the length of the intersection. If the length is less than 2, it returns "NO" (since 0 and 1 are not primes). Finally, it checks if the length is prime by testing divisibility from 2 to the square root of the length. If no divisors are found, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".
