    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given two positive integers a and b.
 We need to return the even digits between a and b in ascending order.
 Note: The digits we consider are 0,2,4,6,8 (even digits). However, note the examples: 
   generate_integers(2,8) returns [2,4,6,8] and generate_integers(10,14) returns [].
 The problem says "even digits", meaning the numbers themselves must be even digits (i.e., single-digit even numbers).
 So we are only looking for numbers that are in the set {0,2,4,6,8}. But note: the problem says positive integers, so 0 is not included.
 Therefore, the even digits we care about are 2,4,6,8.

 Steps:
 1. Since the range might be given in any order (a to b or b to a), we should first determine the start and end of the range.
    Let low = min(a, b) and high = max(a, b).
 2. We need to iterate from low to high (inclusive) and check if a number is an even digit (i.e., in {2,4,6,8}).
 3. Collect these numbers in a list and return in ascending order (which is natural since we iterate from low to high).

 However, note: the example generate_integers(10,14) returns [] because there are no even digits between 10 and 14 (since 10,12,14 are two-digit numbers and not in the set of even digits which are single-digit).

 Implementation:
   We define the set of even digits: even_digits = {2,4,6,8}
   Then we iterate fro
