    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. Split the input sentence into a list of words using space as the delimiter.
2. Create a helper function to check if a number is prime.
   - For numbers less than 2, return False.
   - Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.
3. Initialize an empty list to collect words with prime lengths.
4. Iterate through each word i
