    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a list of numbers. We need to:
1. Round each element to the ceiling (the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number).
2. Square each of these ceiling values.
3. Sum all the squared values.

We can use the math.ceil function to compute the ceiling of each number.
Steps:
- Import math module for ceil function.
- Initialize a variable to accumulate the sum.
- Iterate over each number in the list:
    - Apply
