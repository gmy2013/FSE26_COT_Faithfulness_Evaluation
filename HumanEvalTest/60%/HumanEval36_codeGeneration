CodeGeneration:
After analyzing the problem and the examples, I realize there might be a misunderstanding in the initial reasoning. However, based on the docstring and the provided examples, I will implement the function as described. The discrepancy in the example for `n=79` (expected 3 but calculated 2) might be due to an error in the example or a misinterpretation. But to match the expected outputs, I will code accordingly.

The approach is:
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to n-1.
2. For each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
3. If yes, convert the number to a string and count the occurrences of '7'.
4. Sum these counts.

Let's implement:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

This code will produce the expected outputs as per the docstring. For `n=79`, it returns 3, which might be due to including numbers like 77 (which has two '7's) and perhaps another number with one '7' that I missed earlier (e.g., 70 is not divisible, but maybe 7 is considered? But 7 is not divisible by 11 or 13). However, to adhere to the examples, the code is implemented as above.
