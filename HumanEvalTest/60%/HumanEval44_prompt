The following is chain of thought:
We are converting a number x to a given base (which is less than 10).
 Since base is less than 10, we can use digits 0 to base-1.
 We need to return a string representation.

 Steps:
 1. Handle the case when x is 0: return "0".
 2. We will build the digits from least significant to most.
 3. While x is greater than 0:
    - Get the remainder when dividing by base.
    - Prepend the remainder (as a string) to the result.
    - Update x to be x // base.
 4. Alternatively, we can build the string in reverse and then reverse it at the end.
    But since we are prepending, we can also build the list of digits and then combine.

 However, note: prepending to a string repeatedly is inefficient. Instead, we can collect digits in a list and then reverse and join.

 Implementation:
   digits = []
   while x > 0:
        digits.append(str(x % base))
        x //= base
   if not digits:  # if x was 0
        return "0"
   return ''.join(digits[::-1])

 But note: the example change_base(8,2) returns '1000'. So we are building from the most significant to least.

 Alternatively, we can build the string by prepending (but that is O(n^2) so we avoid.

 Let's code accordingly.
 However, note: the function should also work for negative numbers? The docstring doesn't specify. But the examples are positive.
 Since the problem says "input number x", and examples are positive, we assume non-negative.

 But the type hint is int, which can be negative. However, the examples are positive.
 We should handle negative numbers? The docstring doesn't say. But the examples are positive.

 Since the problem says "base numbers are less than 10", and doesn't specify negative, we assume x is non-negative.

 So we proceed for non-negative x.
