def valid_date(date):
    """You have to write a function which validates a given date string and
    returns True if the date is valid otherwise False.
    The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:
    1. The date string is not empty.
    2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
    3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
    4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

    for example: 
    valid_date('03-11-2000') => True

    valid_date('15-01-2012') => False

    valid_date('04-0-2040') => False

    valid_date('06-04-2020') => True

    valid_date('06/04/2020') => False
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Check if the date string is empty -> return False.
2. Check the format: it must be exactly in "mm-dd-yyyy" format with dashes.
   - Split the string by '-'. There should be exactly 3 parts.
   - Each part should be numeric (digits only).
3. Extract month, day, year as integers.
4. Check month range: must be between 1 and 12.
5. For day validation:
   - For months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12: day between 1 and 31.
   - For months 4,6,9,11: day between 1 and 30.
   - For month 2: day between 1 and 29 (we are not considering leap years here as per the problem).
6. Return True only if all checks pass.

Now, let's implement accordingly.

Note: We assume the input string has exactly the format with two digits for month and day, and four for year? Actually, the examples show two-digit month and day, but the rules don't specify leading zeros. However, the examples like '04-0-2040' is invalid because day is 0 (which is less than 1) and also it has only one digit. So we should check that after splitting, the month and day parts have exactly two digits? Actually, the problem says "format: mm-dd-yyyy", meaning two-digit month, two-digit day, four-digit year. So we should also check the length of each part.

But wait: the example '04-0-2040' has day part as "0" which is one digit. So it should be invalid. Similarly, '15-01-2012' has month=15 which is invalid.

So we should check:
- After splitting by '-', there should be 3 parts.
- Part0 (month) should be exactly 2 digits.
- Part1 (day) should be exactly 2 digits.
- Part2 (year) should be exactly 4 digits.

But the problem does not explicitly say that the digits must be two for month and day and four for year? However, the examples and the format description imply it.

Looking at the examples:
- '03-11-2000' -> valid (two-digit month and day, four-digit year)
- '15-01-2012' -> invalid (month=15 is out of range)
- '04-0-2040' -> invalid (day is one digit: "0", not two digits)
- '06-04-2020' -> valid
- '06/04/2020' -> invalid (wrong separator)

So we should enforce:
- The string has exactly 10 characters? Actually, with two dashes: so total length 10? But wait: "mm-dd-yyyy" is 2+1+2+1+4=10. So we can also check the length is 10.

Alternatively, we can split by '-' and check the lengths of the parts.

Let's code accordingly.

Steps in code:
1. If date is empty string -> False.
2. Check if the string has exactly 10 characters? Actually, not necessary: we can split by '-'.
3. Split the string by '-'. If the result doesn't have exactly 3 p
