    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to iterate through the list with both index and value.
2. For each element:
   - If the index is a multiple of 3: square the value.
   - Else if the index is a multiple of 4 (and not multiple of 3, which is already handled by the first condition): cube the value.
   - Otherwise: keep the value unchanged.
3. Sum all the processed values.

Note: Indexes start at 0 (so index 0 is multiple of both 3 and 4, but we priorit
