The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to linearly transform a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The steps are:

1. Find the minimum value in the list.
2. Find the maximum value in the list.
3. For each number in the list, apply the transformation: (number - min) / (max - min).
4. Return the transformed list.
