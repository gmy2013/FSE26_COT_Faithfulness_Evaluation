    """Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
    duplicate values.

    Examples:

    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1

The following is chain of thought:
We are to find the largest index where arr[i] <= arr[i-1] (i.e., not greater than preceding element)
 Since no duplicates, we're looking for indices where the element breaks the strictly increasing pattern
 We need to return the largest index where this occurs, or -1 if no such index exists
 Approach:
   Iterate from index 1 to len(arr)-1 (since we compare with previous element)
   Check if current element <= previous element
   Track the largest index where this condition is true
   If we find any such index, return the largest one found
   If none found, return -1

 Steps:
   1. Initialize a variable to store the result, starting at -1
   2. Loop through indices from 1 to n-1 (inclusive)
   3. For each index i, check if arr[i] <= arr[i-1]
   4. If true, update result to i (since we want largest index, we can simply update whenever we find a valid one)
   5. After loop, return result

 Note: Since we iterate from le
