Looking at the problem and the examples, I need to find if there exists a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. The key insight is that we need to find a pattern of four brackets in order: an outer open bracket, an inner open bracket, an inner close bracket, and an outer close bracket.

Here's an efficient solution:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

    is_nested('[[]]') ➞ True
    is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[][]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[]') ➞ False
    is_nested('[[][]]') ➞ True
    is_nested('[[]][[') ➞ True
    '''
    n = len(string)
    
    # We need at least 4 brackets to have nesting
    if n < 4:
        return False
    
    # Look for the pattern: [, [, ], ] in order
    for i in range(n):
        if string[i] == '[':
            # Look for second [ after i
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if string[j] == '[':
                    # Look for first ] after j
                    for k in range(j + 1, n):
                        if string[k] == ']':
                            # Look for second ] after k
                            for l in range(k + 1, n):
                                if string[l] == ']':
                                    return True
    return False
```

This solution works by searching for the minimal nested pattern `[[ ]]` in the string. We look for four brackets in the specific order: open, open, close, close. If we can find such a sequence (skipping any unwanted brackets in between), then we have a valid nested subsequence.

The algorithm:
1. Iterates through all possible outer open brackets
2. For each outer open, looks for an inner open bracket after it
3. For each inner open, looks for its matching close bracket
4. For each inner close, looks for the outer close bracket
5. Returns True as soon as we find a valid nested pattern

This handles all the test cases correctly:
- `[[]]` → True (direct nested pattern)
- `[]]]]]]][[[[[]` → False (no valid nested pattern)
- `[][]` → False (parallel brackets, no nesting)
- `[]` → False (too short for nesting)
- `[[][]]` → True (contains nested pattern)
- `[[]][[` → True (contains nested pattern in first part)
