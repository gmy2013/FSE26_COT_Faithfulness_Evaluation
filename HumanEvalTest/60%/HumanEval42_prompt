The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.

Approach:
1. We can use a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list.
2. For each element, add 1 to it and collect the results into a new list.
