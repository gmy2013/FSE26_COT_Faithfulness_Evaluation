CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the `sort_third` function:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Extract values at indices divisible by 3
    to_sort = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Sort the extracted values
    to_sort.sort()
    
    # Create result list by replacing values at divisible-by-3 indices with sorted values
    result = []
    sorted_index = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(to_sort[sorted_index])
            sorted_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(l[i])
    
    return result
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a list `to_sort` containing all elements at indices divisible by 3
2. Sorts these values in ascending order
3. Builds the result list by iterating through the original list and replacing values at divisible-by-3 indices with the sorted values in order
4. Preserves all other values from the original list

The function correctly handles the provided test cases and follows the specified requirements.
