The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with a balance of 0.
2. We iterate through each operation in the list:
   - For each operation, we update the balance by adding the operation value (since positive numbers are deposits and negative are withdrawals).
3. After each update, we check if the balance has fallen below zero.
4. If at any point the balance becomes negative, we immediately return True.
5. If we finish all o
