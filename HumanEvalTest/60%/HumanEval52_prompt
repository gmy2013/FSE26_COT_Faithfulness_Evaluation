The following is chain of thought:
We are given a list `l` and a threshold `t`.
 We need to check if every number in `l` is strictly below `t`.
 We can iterate through each number in the list and check if any number is >= t.
 If we find any number >= t, we return False.
 If we go through the entire list without finding such a number, we return True.

 Alternatively, we can
