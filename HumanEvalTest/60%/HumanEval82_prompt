The following is chain of thought:
We are given a string and need to check if its length is a prime number.
 Steps:
 1. Get the length of the input string.
 2. Handle edge cases: 
    - If the length is 0 or 1, they are not prime numbers.
 3. For numbers >= 2, check for primality:
    - A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
    - We can iterate from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusiv
