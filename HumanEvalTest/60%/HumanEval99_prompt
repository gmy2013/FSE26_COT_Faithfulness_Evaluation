def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:
1. Convert the string input to a float to handle both integers and decimals.
2. We need to round to the nearest integer, but with a special rule for tie-breaking (away from zero).
3. Standard rounding in Python (round()) uses "round half to even" which rounds to the nearest even integer for .5 cases.
4. However, we need "round half away from zero", meaning:
   - For positive numbers: 14.5 rounds to 15 (up)
   - For negative numbers: -14.5 rounds to -15 (down)
5. We can implement this by checking if the fractional part is exactly 0.5 (or -0.5 for negatives) and then rounding accordingly.

Approach:
- Convert string to float.
- Check if the number is exactly halfway between two integers (i.e., fractional part is 0.5 or -0.5).
- If it is, round away from zero: for positive, ceil; for negative, floor.
- Otherwise, use standard rounding (which will work correctly for non-tie cases).

Implementation:
1. Let n = float(value)
2. Check if n is positive and has fractional part exactly 0.5: then return ceil(n)
3. Check if n is negative and has fractional part exactly -0.5: then return floor(n)
4. Else: return round(n)

Note: We need to be cautious with floating point precision. Instead of comparing to 0.5 exactly, we might use a tolerance.

However, since the input is a string representing a number, we can assume exact representation for .5 cases.
But to be safe, we can check with a tolerance.

Alternatively, we can use the decimal module for exact decimal representation, but the problem says the input is a string that represents a number, so we can rely on float for these cases.

Let's code accordingly.
```python
def closest_integer(value):
    n = float(value)
    fractional = n % 1
    if n >= 0:
        if abs(fractional - 0.5) < 1e-10:
            return int(n) + 1
        else:
            return round(n)
    else:
        if abs(fractional + 0.5) < 1e-10:
            return int(n) - 1
        else:
            return round(n)
```

But note: for negative numbers, the fractional part is negative (e.g., -14.5 % 1 is 0.5 in Python? Actually, modulo for negatives in Python returns a non-negative remainder. So for -14.5, n % 1 would be 0.5. So we need to adjust.

Actually, for
