The following is chain of thought:
We are checking if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
 Steps:
 1. Normalize the string by converting to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters? 
    But the examples don't require this (e.g., no mixed case or punctuation in test cases).
    The docstring examples are all lowercase and alphanumeric, so we can proceed without normalization.
 2. Compare the string with its reverse.
 3. Return True if they are equal, False
