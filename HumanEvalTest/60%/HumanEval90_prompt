The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to find the second smallest element in a list of integers. If there are fewer than two distinct elements, we should return None.

Approach:
1. If the list has less than 2 elements, return None.
2. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates, then back to a sorted list to get unique sorted values.
3. If the sorted unique list has at least two elements, the second element (inde
