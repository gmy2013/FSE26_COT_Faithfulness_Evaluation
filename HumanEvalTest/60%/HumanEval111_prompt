The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to create a histogram (frequency count) of letters in a given string. The string consists of space-separated lowercase letters. We need to return a dictionary containing the letter(s) with the highest frequency and their count. If multiple letters have the same highest frequency, we include all of them.

Approach:
1. If the input string is empty, return an empty dictionary.
2. Split the string into a list of letters using space as the delimiter.
3. Count the frequency of each letter using a dictionary.
4. Find the maximum frequency value from the counts.
5. Collect all letters that have this maxi
