    # Create a set of characters to delete for efficient lookup
    to_delete = set(c)
    
    # Build the result string by including only characters not in to_delete
    result_str = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in to_delete)
    
    # Check if the result string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = result_str == result_str[::-1]
    
    return (result_str, is_palindrome)
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a set `to_delete` from the characters in `c` for O(1) lookup time
2. Uses a generator expression to filter out characters from `s` that are in the deletion set
3. Joins the filtered characters to form the result string
4. Checks if the result string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse
5. Returns a tuple containing both the result string and the palindrome check result

The solution is efficient with O(n) time complexity for both the filtering and palindrome check operations.
