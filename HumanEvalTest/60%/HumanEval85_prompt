    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a non-empty list of integers.
 We need to add (sum) the even elements that are at odd indices.
 Steps:
 1. Iterate over the indices of the list.
 2. Check if the index is odd (i.e., index % 2 != 0).
 3. For elements at odd indices, check if the element is even (i.e., element % 2 == 0).
 4. Sum all such elements.

 Example: For [4, 2, 6, 7]:
   Indices: 0 (even index, skip), 1 (odd index), 2 (even index, skip), 3 (odd index).
   At index 1: element is 2 (even) -> include
