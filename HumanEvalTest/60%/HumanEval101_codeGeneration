pace.
 2. Use the split() method to split the string by spaces (which will also handle multiple consecutive spaces).
 3. Return the resulting list.

 Let's implement accordingly.
```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces to unify separators
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    # Split by spaces (split() handles multiple spaces automatically)
    return s.split()
```
