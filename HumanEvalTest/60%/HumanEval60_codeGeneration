CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This implementation:
1. Handles non-positive inputs correctly by returning 0 (since you can't sum from 1 to a non-positive number)
2. Uses the efficient arithmetic series formula `n*(n+1)//2` for positive inputs
3. Passes all the provided test cases in the docstring
4. Works for any integer input while maintaining the expected behavior described in the function's purpose
