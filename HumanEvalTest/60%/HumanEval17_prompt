def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each
    not last.

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat

    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let me break down the problem:

1. We need to parse a string containing musical note symbols
2. Each symbol represents a note with a specific beat duration
3. We need to convert each symbol to its corresponding beat count
4. The symbols are: 'o' (4 beats), 'o|' (2 beats), '.|' (1 beat)
5. The symbols are separated by spaces in the input string

Approach:
1. Split the input string by spaces to get individual symbols
2. For each symbol, map it to the corresponding beat value
3. Return the list of beat values

Let me implement this step by step:
- Split the music_string by spaces to get a list of symbols
