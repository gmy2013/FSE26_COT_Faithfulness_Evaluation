CodeGeneration:
I'll implement the function by constructing a string expression and evaluating it with `eval()`. Since the input is trusted (only allowed operators and non-negative integers), this approach is safe and straightforward.

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

    """
    # Build the expression string by alternating operands and operators
    expression = str(operand[0])
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        expression += " " + operator[i] + " " + str(operand[i + 1])
    
    # Evaluate the expression
    return eval(expression)
```

The function works by:
1. Starting with the first operand as a string
2. Iterating through the operators and remaining operands to build the complete expression string
3. Using `eval()` to evaluate the mathematical expression with proper operator precedence
4. Returning the result

This handles all the specified operators with their correct precedence rules (exponentiation first, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction).
