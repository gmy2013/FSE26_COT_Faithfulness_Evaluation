def max_element(l: list):
    """Return maximum element in the list.
    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
    3
    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    123
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Looking at the function requirements:
1. Need to find the maximum element in a list
2. The function should return the maximum value
3. The examples show it should work with both positive and negative numbers

Since this is a basic maximum finding operation, I can use Python's built-in max() function which efficiently finds the maximum element in an iterable.

The implementation is straightforward:
- Use max(l) to find the maximum element
- Return the result
