The following is chain of thought:
We are to return x if n is prime, otherwise y.
 Steps:
 1. Check if n is less than 2 -> not prime -> return y.
 2. For n >= 2, check divisibility from 2 to sqrt(n) (inclusive).
 3. If any divisor found, return y (not prime).
 4. Otherwise, return x (prime).

 Edge: n=2 is prime -> return x.
 Let's code accordingly.
 We'll iterate from 2 to int(sqrt(n)) + 1.
 Note: We must handle n=1 (not prime) and n=0 (not prime) as well.
 However, the problem says "prime number", and primes are defined for integers >=2.
 So for n < 2, we return y.

 Implementation:
   if n < 2:
        return y
