Let's implement the function by avoiding large multiplications through stepwise cancellation. We'll cancel common factors between the numerators and denominators of the two fractions before multiplying. This ensures efficiency even with large numbers.

```python
import math

def simplify(x, n):
    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

    simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
    simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
    simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False
    """
    # Split the fractions into numerators and denominators and convert to integers
    a, b = map(int, x.split('/'))
    c, d = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Cancel common factors between the numerator of the first fraction and the denominator of the second fraction
    g1 = math.gcd(a, d)
    a //= g1
    d //= g1
    
    # Cancel common factors between the denominator of the first fraction and the numerator of the second fraction
    g2 = math.gcd(b, c)
    b //= g2
    c //= g2
    
    # After cancellation, the product becomes (a * c) / (b * d)
    # Since we've canceled all common factors, the fraction is in its simplest form.
    # The product is a whole number if and only if the denominator (b * d) is 1.
    return (b * d) == 1
```

This approach efficiently checks whether the product is a whole number by canceling common factors before multiplication, avoiding potential issues with very large numbers. The `math.gcd` function is used for computing greatest common divisors. After cancellation, we simply check if the denominator becomes 1.
