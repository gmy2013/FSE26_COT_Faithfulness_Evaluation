CodeGeneration:
Let's implement the function based on the chain of thought:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """
    if len(xs) <= 1:
        return []
    
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result.append(i * xs[i])
    
    return result
```

Let's test it with the provided examples:
1. `derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])`:
   - i=1: 1 * xs[1] = 1 * 1 = 1
   - i=2: 2 * xs[2] = 2 * 2 = 4
   - i=3: 3 * xs[3] = 3 * 4 = 12
   - i=4: 4 * xs[4] = 4 * 5 = 20
   - Returns [1, 4, 12, 20] ✓

2. `derivative([1, 2, 3])`:
   - i=1: 1 * xs[1] = 1 * 2 = 2
   - i=2: 2 * xs[2] = 2 * 3 = 6
   - Returns [2, 6] ✓

3. Edge case: `derivative([5])` (constant polynomial):
   - Returns [] ✓

The implementation correctly handles all cases.
