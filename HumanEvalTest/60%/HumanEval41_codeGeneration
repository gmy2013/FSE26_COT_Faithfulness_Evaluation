# Each left-to-right car will collide with every right-to-left car that it meets
    # Since all cars move at the same speed, the collisions occur when the positions align
    # This is equivalent to counting all pairs between the two sets of cars
    # Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * n = nÂ²
    
    return n * n
