The following is chain of thought:
We are given a positive integer n. We need to compute the product of its odd digits.
 Steps:
 1. Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit.
 2. Initialize a variable for the product (start at 1) and a flag to check if we found at least one odd digit.
 3. Iterate over each character in the string:
    - Convert the character back to an integer to check if it is odd.
    - If the digit is odd, multiply it to the product and mark that we found an odd digit.
 4. If no odd digit was found, return 0. Otherwise, return the product.

 However, note: if we start with product=1 and multiply by odd digits, if there are no odd digits the product remains 1.
 But we need to return 0 in that case. So we can either:
    Option 1: Check during iteration if we found any odd digit. Then at the end, if none found return 0, else return product.
    Option 2: Initialize product to 0? But then multiplying would be problematic. Alternatively, we can set a flag.

 Let's use a flag (found_odd) initially set to False.

 Alternatively, we can also note: if we don't find any odd digit, the product remains 1. Then we can check at the end: if product is 1 and we never multiplied (meaning no
