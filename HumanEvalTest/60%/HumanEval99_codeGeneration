CodeGeneration:
```python
def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
    '''
    n = float(value)
    
    # Check if the number is exactly halfway between two integers
    if abs(n - int(n)) == 0.5:
        if n > 0:
            return int(n) + 1
        else:
            return int(n) - 1
    else:
        return round(n)
```

This implementation:
1. Converts the string input to a float
2. Checks if the number is exactly halfway between two integers by comparing the fractional part to 0.5
3. For positive numbers that are halfway, rounds up (away from zero)
4. For negative numbers that are halfway, rounds down (away from zero)
5. For all other cases, uses Python's built-in `round()` function which handles normal rounding correctly

The solution handles the edge cases specified in the docstring while being efficient and readable.
