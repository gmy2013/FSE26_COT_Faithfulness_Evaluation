CodeGeneration:
n the list of words.
5. For each word, check if the length of the word is a prime number using the helper function.
6. If it is, add the word to the list of words to keep.
7. Finally, join the list of kept words with spaces and return the resulting string.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    result_words = []
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):
            result_words.append(word)
    return ' '.join(result_words)
```
