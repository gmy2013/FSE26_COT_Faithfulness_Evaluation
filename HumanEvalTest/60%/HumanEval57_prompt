The following is chain of thought:
We are checking if the list is either entirely non-decreasing or entirely non-increasing.
 Steps:
 1. Check if the list has less than 2 elements - if yes, return True (trivially monotonic).
 2. Check for non-decreasing: traverse the list and check if every element is >= the previous.
 3. Check for non-increasing: traverse the list and check if every element is <= the previous.
 4. Return True if either non-decreasing or non-increasing is True.

 However, note: the examples include strictly increasing/decreasing, but the problem
