    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    

    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12

The following is chain of thought:
The function needs to sum odd integers that are at even indices (0-indexed, so indices 0, 2, 4, etc.).

Chain of thought:
1. Iterate through the list with both index and value
2. Check if the index is even (index % 2 == 0)
3. Check if the value is odd (value % 2 == 1)
4. If both conditions are true, add the value to the sum
5. Return the total sum

We can use enumerate() to get both index and value, and a generator expression with sum() for efficiency.
