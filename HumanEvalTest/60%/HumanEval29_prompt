The following is chain of thought:
We are given a list of strings and a prefix string.
 We need to return a new list containing only the strings that start with the given prefix.
 We can iterate through each string in the input list and check if it starts with the prefix.
 We can use list comprehension for a concise solution.
 The function should return an empty list if no strings
