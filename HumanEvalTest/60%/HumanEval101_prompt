 Then, we can split the string by spaces to get the words. However, we must be cautious about multiple spaces.
 Alternatively, we can use a regular expression to split on both commas and spaces, but that might be overkill.
 Another approach: split the string by commas first, then split each resulting part by spaces, and combine.
 However, a simpler method is to replace all commas with spaces and then use split() which handles multiple spaces.

 Steps:
 1. Replace every comma in the string with a s
