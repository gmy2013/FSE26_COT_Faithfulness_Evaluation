def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
    """
    # Split the string while preserving spaces
    parts = re.split(r'( +)', s)
    result = []
    for part in parts:
        # If the part consists only of spaces, keep it as is
        if part.isspace():
            result.append(part)
        else:
            # Sort the characters in the word by ASCII value
            result.append(''.join(sorted(part)))
    return ''.join(result)
