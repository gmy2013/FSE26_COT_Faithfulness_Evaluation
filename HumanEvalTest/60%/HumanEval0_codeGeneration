CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:
                return True
    return False
```

The function works by:
1. Iterating through each element in the list using index `i`
2. For each element at index `i`, comparing it with all subsequent elements using index `j` (starting from `i+1`)
3. Calculating the absolute difference between each pair of numbers
4. Returning `True` immediately if any pair is closer than the threshold
5. Returning `False` if no such pair is found after checking all combinations

This approach efficiently checks all unique pairs without duplication and has O(nÂ²) time complexity, which is suitable for reasonably sized lists.
