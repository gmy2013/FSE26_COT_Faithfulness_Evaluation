def is_happy(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
    For example:
    is_happy(a) => False
    is_happy(aa) => False
    is_happy(abcd) => True
    is_happy(aabb) => False
    is_happy(adb) => True
    is_happy(xyy) => False
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if the length of string `s` is less than 3. If yes, return False because the string cannot have three consecutive letters.
2. Iterate through the string starting from index 0 to index `len(s)-3` (inclusive) to check every possible triplet of consecutive characters.
3. For each triplet (characters at positions i, i+1, i+2), check if all three characters are distinct.
4. If any triplet is found where characters are not distinct (i.e., at least two are the same), return False imme
