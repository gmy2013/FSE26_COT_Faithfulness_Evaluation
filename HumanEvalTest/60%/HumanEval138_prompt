The following is chain of thought:
To determine if a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, note that every positive even number is at least 2. Therefore, the smallest possible sum is 2+2+2+2=8. So, if `n < 8`, it cannot be represented.

Additionally, since all numbers are even, their sum must be even. So, if `n` is odd, it cannot be represented.

For even `n >= 8`, we can always represent it as the sum of four even numbers. For example:
- For n=8: 2+2+2+2
- For n=10: 2+2+2+4
- For n=12: 2+2+2+6 or 2+2+4+4, etc.

Thus, the function should return True if `n` i
