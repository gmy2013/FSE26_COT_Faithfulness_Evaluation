CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the chain of thought:

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    """
    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0
    >>> prod_signs([]) == None
    """
    if not arr:
        return None
    
    product = 1
    sum_magnitudes = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        # Determine the sign of the current number
        if num > 0:
            sign = 1
        elif num < 0:
            sign = -1
        else:  # num == 0
            sign = 0
        
        # Update the product of signs
        product *= sign
        
        # Add the absolute value (magnitude) to the sum
        sum_magnitudes += abs(num)
    
    return product * sum_magnitudes
```

This implementation:
1. Returns `None` for empty arrays
2. Calculates the product of all signs (1, -1, or 0)
3. Calculates the sum of absolute values (magnitudes)
4. Returns the product of these two values

The examples work as expected:
- `[1, 2, 2, -4]`: signs = [1, 1, 1, -1] → product = -1, magnitudes = [1, 2, 2, 4] → sum = 9, result = -9
- `[0, 1]`: signs = [0, 1] → product = 0, magnitudes = [0, 1] → sum = 1, result = 0
- `[]`: returns `None`
