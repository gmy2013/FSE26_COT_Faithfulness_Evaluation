def circular_shift(x, shift):
    """Circular shift the digits of the integer x, shift the digits right by shift
    and return the result as a string.
    If shift > number of digits, return digits reversed.
    >>> circular_shift(12, 1)

    >>> circular_shift(12, 2)
    "12"

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Convert the integer x to a string to work with its digits.
2. Calculate the number of digits (n) in x.
3. If shift is greater than the number of digits, return the reversed string of digits.
4. Otherwise, perform a circular shift right by shift:
   - A circular shift right by shift means taking the last 'shift' digits and moving them to the front.
   - For example: "1234" with shift=2 becomes "3412".
5. Return the result as a string
