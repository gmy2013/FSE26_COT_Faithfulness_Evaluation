The following is chain of thought:
We are comparing two values that can be integers, floats, or strings representing numbers (with either '.' or ',' as decimal separator).
 Steps:
 1. Convert both inputs to a common numeric type (float) for comparison, handling the string cases appropriately.
 2. If the numeric values are equal, return None.
 3. Otherwise, return the original value (a or b) that corresponds to the larger numeric value.

 How to handle string conversion?
   - If the value is a string, replace any comma with a dot to handle both decimal separators, then convert to float.
   - If it's already a number (int or float), we can directly use it.

 However, note: we must return the original variable (with its original type and representation) of the larger one.

 Important: If the values are equal as numbers, return None.

 Implementation:
   Let's define a helper function to convert any input to a float for comparison.

   Example: 
      For a string "5,1" -> replace ',' with '.' -> "5.1" -> float(5.1)
      For a string "6" -> float(6) is straightforward.

   Then, we compare the two numeric values.

   If they are equal, return None.

   Otherwise, we need to return the original value (a or b) that is larger.

   But note: what if both are strings? We should return the string as it was (with the original decimal separator).
   Similarly, if one is int and one is float, we return the original (so if the int is larger, we return the int, not converted to float).

   So we will:
     convert a to float (handling string) -> num_a
     convert b to float (handling string) -> num_b

   Then:
     if num_a == num_b: return None
     elif num_a > num_b: return a
     else: return b

 How to convert to float?
   We can write a function that:
      if type is str: replace ',' with '.', then float(...)
      else: float(value)  [this works for int and float already]

 However, note: what if the string has multiple commas? Actually, the problem says "real numbers", so we assume only one decimal separator.
   But to be safe, we replace all commas? Actually, in numbers, commas are used as decimal separator only once. Also, sometimes commas are used as thousand separators?
   The problem says: "the floating point might be . or ,", meaning that the decimal separator is either dot or comma. So we should only replace the decimal comma.

   However, the examples don't have thousand separators. So we assume the input is a valid representation of a real number.

   But note: the string might be "2,3" meaning 2.3, or "6" meaning 6.0.

   Actually, the problem does not specify thousand separators, so we assume no thousand separators. Only one decimal separator.

   So we can simply replace every comma with a dot. Why every? Because if there is a comma, it is the decimal separator. There should be only one.

   However, what if the number is "1,000"? That would be interpreted as 1.000 which is 1.0. But if it is meant to be one thousand, that would be wrong.

   But the problem says "strings representing real numbers", and the examples are like "2,3" (which is 2.3) and "5,1" (which is 5.1). So they are using comma as decimal separator.

   Therefore, we replace all commas with dots. This is safe because:
        "2,3" becomes "2.3" -> correct.
        "6" remains "6" -> correct.

   But what if we have a string with multiple commas? Actually, the problem does not specify, but we assume valid input.

   Alternatively, we can replace only the last comma? Because sometimes numbers might have thousand separators and a decimal comma? However, the problem does not mention thousand separators.

   Given the problem context, we assume that the string either has no comma or one comma as decimal separator.

   So we'll replace every comma with a dot. This will work for the examples.

   However, to be more robust, we might consider that in some locales, thousand separators are used. But the problem does not indicate that.

   Since the problem says "the floating point might be . or ,", we assume that the comma is only used as decimal separator.

   Therefore, we proceed with replacing all commas with do
