The following is chain of thought:
We are implementing a function to return the length of a string.
 Since Python has a built-in len() function, we can simply use that.
 However, the problem might be expecting us to implement it without using len().
 But the docstring examples are straightforward and match the behavior of len().
 Given the instructions, we should use the most direct approach.
 Let's use the built-in len() function to return the length.
 Alternatively, we could iterate to count, but that would be inefficient.
 Since the
