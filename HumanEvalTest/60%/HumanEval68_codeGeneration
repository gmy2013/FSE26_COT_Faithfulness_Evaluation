CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the `pluck` function based on the docstring:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    """
    "Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value
    """
    if not arr:
        return []
    
    min_even = None
    min_index = -1
    
    for i, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value % 2 == 0:  # Check if even
            if min_even is None:
                min_even = value
                min_index = i
            elif value < min_even:
                min_even = value
                min_index = i
            elif value == min_even and i < min_index:
                min_index = i
    
    if min_even is None:
        return []
    
    return [min_even, min_index]
```

The function works as follows:
1. First checks if the input array is empty and returns an empty list if true
2. Initializes variables to track the smallest even value and its index
3. Iterates through each element with its index using `enumerate()`
4. For each even number, it compares against the current smallest even value
5. If a smaller even value is found, it updates both the value and index
6. If the same smallest value is found at an earlier index, it updates only the index
7. Returns the result as `[value, index]` or an empty list if no even numbers are found

The solution handles all the test cases correctly and follows the specified constraints.
