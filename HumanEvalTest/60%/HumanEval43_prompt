The following is chain of thought:
Looking at the problem, I need to find if there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero. This means for any element x, there should be another element -x in the list.

Let me think through the approach:
1. I'll use a set to store the numbers I've seen so far for O(1) lookups
2. For each number in the list, I'll check if its negative counterpart exists in the set
3. If found, return True immediately
4. If I finish the loop without finding a pair, return False
5. I need to handle the case where 0 is present - I need two zeros to sum to zero

Wait, but the problem says "distinct elements", so I can't use the same element twice. For 0, I need to check if there are at least two zeros in the list.

Let me implement this step by step:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        # Check if the negative of current number exists in seen
        if -num in seen:
            return
