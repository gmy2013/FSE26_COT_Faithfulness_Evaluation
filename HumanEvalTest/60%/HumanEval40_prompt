The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exist three distinct elements in a list of integers that sum to zero. The solution should efficiently check all possible triplets without duplicates.

Approach:
1. Since we are looking for distinct elements, we can avoid duplicates by sorting the list and skipping repeated numbers to prevent redundant checks.
2. Use a three-pointer technique: fix one element and then use two pointers (left and right) to find pairs that sum to the negative of the fixed element.
3. Sort the list first to facilitate the two-pointer approach.
4. Iterate through each element as the fixed element. For each fixed element at index i, set left pointer to i+1 and right pointer to the end of the list.
5. Calculate the sum of the triplet (fixed, left, right). If the sum is zero, return True.
6. If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer forward to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer backward to decrease the sum.
7. Skip duplicate values for the fixed element and the pointers to avoid processing the same triplet multiple times.
