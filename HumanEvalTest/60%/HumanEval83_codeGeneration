CodeGeneration:
Let's implement the function based on the chain of thought:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 10**(n-1) + 8 * 10**(n-2)
```

This implementation handles the case for n=1 separately (where the count is 1) and uses the derived formula for n>=2: \(10^{n-1} + 8 \cdot 10^{n-2}\).
