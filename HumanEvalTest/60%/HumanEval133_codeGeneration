CodeGeneration:
math.ceil to the number.
    - Square the result.
    - Add to the accumulator.
- Return the accumulator.

Here is the implementation:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        ceiling = math.ceil(num)
        total += ceiling * ceiling
    return total
```
