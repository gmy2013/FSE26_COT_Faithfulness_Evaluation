def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Check if the string contains any letters. We can do this by checking if there is at least one character that is alphabetic.
2. If there are no letters, we reverse the entire string and return it.
3. If there are letters, we iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is a letter, we reverse its case (lower to upper, upper to lower).
   - Otherwise, we leave it unchanged.
4. Return the transformed string.

Now, let's implement accordingly.
