The following is chain of thought:
We are generating all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest.
 The prefixes are: first character, first two characters, ..., the entire string.
 We can use a loop to iterate from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive) and take slices.
 The slice from index 0 to i (exclusive) for i in range(1, len(string)+1) gives each prefix.
 We return the list of these prefix
