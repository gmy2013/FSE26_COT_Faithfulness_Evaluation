CodeGeneration:
The problem allows the same prime to be used multiple times, so we need to consider all combinations including duplicates. The current implementation starts from `i`, `j`, and `k` in a way that might miss some cases where the same prime is used multiple times in different orders. To ensure we cover all possibilities including duplicates, we should iterate through all primes for each position.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    # Generate primes up to 100
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, 101):
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
    
    # Check all combinations of three primes (with repetition allowed)
    for p1 in primes:
        for p2 in primes:
            for p3 in primes:
                if p1 * p2 * p3 == a:
                    return True
    return False
```

This implementation:
1. Generates all prime numbers up to 100 using a simple prime-checking algorithm
2. Uses three nested loops to check all possible combinations of three primes (including using the same prime multiple times)
3. Returns True if any combination's product equals the input number `a`
4. Returns False if no such combination is found

The time complexity is acceptable since there are only 25 primes less than 100, resulting in 25Â³ = 15,625 combinations to check.
