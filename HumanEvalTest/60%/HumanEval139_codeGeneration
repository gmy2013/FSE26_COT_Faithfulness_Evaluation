CodeGeneration:
current_factorial *= i
        result *= current_factorial

This is more efficient as it computes the factorial incrementally and multiplies it into the result in a single pass.

Let me implement this approach.

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
    result = 1
    current_factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_factorial *= i
        result *= current_factorial
    return result
```
