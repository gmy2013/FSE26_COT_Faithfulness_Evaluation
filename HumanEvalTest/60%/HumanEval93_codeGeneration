CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the `encode` function:

```python
def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """
    # First swap case of all letters
    swapped = message.swapcase()
    
    # Define vowel mapping for both cases
    vowel_map = {
        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'
    }
    
    # Replace vowels with letters two places ahead
    result = []
    for char in swapped:
        if char in vowel_map:
            result.append(vowel_map[char])
        else:
            result.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

The function works as follows:
1. First, it swaps the case of all letters using Python's built-in `swapcase()` method
2. Then it creates a mapping dictionary that maps each vowel (both lowercase and uppercase) to the letter two places ahead in the alphabet
3. Finally, it iterates through the swapped-case string and replaces any vowels with their corresponding mapped values, leaving non-vowel characters unchanged

This approach efficiently handles both requirements: case swapping and vowel replacement, in the correct order as specified by the problem.
