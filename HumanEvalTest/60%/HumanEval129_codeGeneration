To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest path of length `k` in an N x N grid. The path can start at any cell and move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) without leaving the grid. The path must visit exactly `k` cells (which can be repeated). The solution involves generating candidate paths and comparing them lexicographically.
