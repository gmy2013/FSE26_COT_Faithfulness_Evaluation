The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to compute two values: the sum and the product of all integers in the list.
2. For an empty list:
   - The sum should be 0 (as stated: empty sum equals 0)
   - The product should be 1 (as stated: empty product equals 1)
3. For a non-empty list:
   - Initialize sum to 0 and product to 1.
   - Iterate through each number in the list:
        - Add the number to the sum.
        - Multiply the product by the number.
4. Return a tuple (sum, product).

We can handle both cases (empty and non-empty) with the same initialization since:
- For an empty list, th
