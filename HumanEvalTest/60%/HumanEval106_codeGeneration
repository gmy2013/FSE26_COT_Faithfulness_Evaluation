CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # i is even
            # Compute factorial of i
            factorial = 1
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                factorial *= j
            result.append(factorial)
        else:  # i is odd
            # Compute sum from 1 to i using arithmetic series formula
            sum_i = i * (i + 1) // 2
            result.append(sum_i)
    return result
```

The function works as follows:
1. Creates an empty list to store results
2. Iterates from i=1 to i=n (inclusive)
3. For even i values, computes the factorial by multiplying all numbers from 1 to i
4. For odd i values, computes the sum using the arithmetic series formula n(n+1)/2
5. Appends each computed value to the result list
6. Returns the completed list

The example f(5) returns [1, 2, 6, 24, 15] as expected:
- i=1 (odd): 1*2//2 = 1
- i=2 (even): 1*2 = 2
- i=3 (odd): 3*4//2 = 6
- i=4 (even): 1*2*3*4 = 24
- i=5 (odd): 5*6//2 = 15
