def reverse_delete(s,c):
    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. We need to remove all characters from `s` that are present in `c`.
2. We can iterate through each character in `s` and only keep those that are not in `c`.
3. We can build a new string by checking each character in `s` against the set of characters in `c` (for efficient lookup).
4. After building the new string, we need to check if it is a palindrome.
5. To check for palindrome, we can compare the string with its reverse.
6. Return a tuple containing the new string and the boolean result of the palindrome check.

Let's implement accordingly.
```python
def reverse_delete(s, c
