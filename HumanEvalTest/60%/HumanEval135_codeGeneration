CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on your chain of thought:

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    """Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
    duplicate values.

    Examples:
    can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1
    """
    result = -1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] <= arr[i-1]:
            result = i
    return result
```

This implementation:
1. Starts with `result = -1` as the default return value
2. Iterates through indices 1 to len(arr)-1 (comparing each element with its predecessor)
3. Updates the result to the current index whenever `arr[i] <= arr[i-1]` is true
4. Returns the largest index found (or -1 if no such index exists)

The function correctly handles the examples:
- `can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5])` returns 3 because at index 3, 3 â‰¤ 4
- `can_arrange([1,2,3])` returns -1 because all elements are strictly increasing
