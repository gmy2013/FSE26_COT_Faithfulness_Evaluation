def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Find the intersection of two intervals**:
   - The intersection of two closed intervals [a1, b1] and [a2, b2] is [max(a1, a2), min(b1, b2)].
   - If max(a1, a2) > min(b1, b2), there is no intersection.

2. **Calculate the length of the intersection**:
   - For an intersection [x, y], the length is (y - x + 1) because it's a closed interval (includes both endpoints).
   - However, note: in the example (1,3) and (2,4) intersect at (2,3). The length is 3-2+1=2? But the example says length is 1.
   - Correction: The problem says "length" meaning the number of integers in the interval. For (2,3), the integers are {2,3} which is 2 numbers. But the example says length is 1? Wait, there is a misunderstanding.

Wait, let's read the example again: "the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3) which its length is 1". This suggests that the length is computed as (end - start) without adding 1? But that would be inconsistent with closed intervals.

Actually, the problem says: "the length of intersection". In the example, (2,3) has length 3-2=1.
