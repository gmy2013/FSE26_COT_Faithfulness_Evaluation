CodeGeneration:
2 + 2 + 2 + (n - 6). Since n is even and >=8, n-6 is even and >=2, which is positive and even. Therefore, for even n >=8, it is always possible.

However, let's verify with the examples:
- n=4: even but <8 → False
- n=6: even but <8 → False
- n=8: even and >=8 → True (2+2+2+2)

So the function can be implemented as:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```
