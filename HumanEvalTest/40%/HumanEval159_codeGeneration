CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)
    """
    carrots_to_eat = min(need, remaining)
    total_eaten = number + carrots_to_eat
    left_after = remaining - carrots_to_eat
    
    return [total_eaten, left_after]
```

This implementation:
1. Calculates how many carrots we can actually eat by taking the minimum of `need` and `remaining`
2. Adds this to the already eaten carrots to get the total eaten
3. Subtracts the eaten carrots from the remaining stock
4. Returns the result as a list with two elements

The function handles all the test cases correctly:
- `eat(5, 6, 10)` → `min(6, 10) = 6`, so `[5+6, 10-6] = [11, 4]`
- `eat(4, 8, 9)` → `min(8, 9) = 8`, so `[4+8, 9-8] = [12, 1]`
- `eat(1, 10, 10)` → `min(10, 10) = 10`, so `[1+10, 10-10] = [11, 0]`
- `eat(2, 11, 5)` → `min(11, 5) = 5`, so `[2+5, 5-5] = [7, 0]`
