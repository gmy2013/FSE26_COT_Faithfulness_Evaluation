CodeGeneration:
vert the rounded integer to binary using bin() function, which returns a string starting with '0b'.
5. Return the binary string.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    avg = (n + m) / 2.0
    rounded = round(avg)
    return bin(rounded)
```
