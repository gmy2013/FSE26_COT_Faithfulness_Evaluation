CodeGeneration:
We can compute the product of factorials from 1! to n! by first computing the factorial for each integer from 1 to n and then multiplying them together. We'll use dynamic programming to compute the factorials efficiently.

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
    # Initialize the factorial for 1
    fact = 1
    # Initialize the product of factorials
    product = 1
    # Iterate from 1 to n
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        # Compute k! by multiplying the previous factorial by k
        fact *= k
        # Multiply the current product by k!
        product *= fact
    return product
```

This code efficiently computes the special factorial by maintaining a running factorial and accumulating the product of these factorials in a single pass. The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
