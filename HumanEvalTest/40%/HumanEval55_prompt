The following is chain of thought:
We are to implement a function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.
 The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...
 Note: The problem examples: fib(10)=55, fib(1)=1, fib(8)=21.
 This suggests that the first Fibonacci number (n=1) is 1, and n=2 is 1, e
