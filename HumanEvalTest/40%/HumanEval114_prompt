    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example
    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are to find the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray.
 This is similar to the classic "maximum subarray sum" problem (Kadane's algorithm) but for minimum.
 We can use a similar approach by iterating and keeping track of the current minimum sum ending at each index.
 Steps:
 1. Initialize current_min = nums[0] and global_min = nums[0]
