CodeGeneration:
Let's continue the chain of thought and implement the solution:

7. From the analysis, we know that for each 1-indexed index i:
   - If i % 3 == 2, then a[i] ≡ 0 mod 3
   - Otherwise (i % 3 == 0 or 1), a[i] ≡ 1 mod 3

8. Therefore, we can count:
   - Let count0 = number of indices i (1-indexed) where i % 3 == 2 (these give values ≡ 0 mod 3)
   - Let count1 = number of indices i (1-indexed) where i % 3 != 2 (these give values ≡ 1 mod 3)

9. The valid triples (i, j, k) must have their sum ≡ 0 mod 3. Since the values are only 0 or 1 mod 3, the valid combinations are:
   - All three values are 0: (0,0,0)
   - All three values are 1: (1,1,1) because 1+1+1=3≡0 mod 3

10. Therefore, the total number of valid triples is:
    total = C(count0, 3) + C(count1, 3)
    where C(n, k) is the combination "n choose k".

11. Now, we need to compute count0 and count1 for indices from 1 to n (1-indexed).

    For indices from 1 to n:
        count0 = number of integers i in [1, n] such that i % 3 == 2
        count1 = number of integers i in [1, n] such that i % 3 != 2 (i.e., i % 3 == 0 or 1)

12. How to compute count0?
    The numbers with i % 3 == 2 in the range [1, n] form an arithmetic sequence: 2, 5, 8, ... up to ≤ n.
    The number of such numbers is: floor((n - 2) / 3) + 1, if n >= 2. Otherwise 0.

    Alternatively, we can use:
        count0 = (n + 1) // 3   [but careful: for n=1: (1+1)//3=0, correct; n=2: (2+1)//3=1, correct; n=3: (3+1)//3=1, correct (only i=2); n=4: (4+1)//3=1, but we have i=2 and i=5? wait no, i=5>4, so only i=2. Actually it should be: count0 = (n - 2 + 3) // 3? Let me derive properly.

    Actually, the formula for the count of numbers ≡ r mod m in [1, n] is:
        count = (n - r) // m + 1   if n >= r, else 0.

    For r=2, m=3:
        if n < 2: count0=0
        else: count0 = (n - 2) // 3 + 1

    Similarly, for count1 = n - count0.

13. However, we can avoid complex formulas by simply iterating from 1 to n and counting, but since n can be large, we want an O(1) solution.

    Actually, we can compute:
        count0 = (n - 2 + 3) // 3   if n>=2, else 0? Let's test with n=2: (2-2+3)=3//3=1, correct.
        n=3: (3-2+3)=4//3=1 (integer division), correct.
        n=4: (4-2+3)=5//3=1, correct (only i=2).
        n=5: (5-2+3)=6//3=2, correct (i=2 and i=5).

    So generally: count0 = (n + 1) // 3? For n=2: (2+1)//3=1, n=3: (3+1)//3=1, n=4: (4+1)//3=1, n=5: (5+1)//3=2. This matches.

    Therefore, we can use:
        count0 = (n + 1) // 3
        count1 = n - count0

14. But wait: for n=1: count0 = (1+1)//3 = 0, count1=1, correct.
    So it works.

15. Therefore, the solution is:
        count0 = (n + 1) // 3
        count1 = n - count0
        total_triples = C(count0, 3) + C(count1, 3)

    where C(x,3) = x*(x-1)*(x-2)//6 if x>=3, else 0.

16. Let's verify with the example n=5:
        count0 = (5+1)//3 = 6//3 = 2
        count1 = 5-2 = 3
        C(2,3)=0 (since 2<3)
        C(3,3)=1
        total=1, which matches the example.

17. Implementation:

    We'll write the function accordingly.

Code:
```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    count0 = (n + 1) // 3
    count1 = n - count0
    
    def comb3(x):
        if x < 3:
            return 0
        return x * (x-1) * (x-2) // 6
    
    return comb3(count0) + comb3(count1)
```

This solution is efficient with O(1) time and space complexity.
