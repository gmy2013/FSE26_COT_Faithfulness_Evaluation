CodeGeneration:
e modulo operation correctly to wrap around the alphabet.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

However, we need to be careful with negative modulo results. In Python, `-1 % 26` equals 25, which correctly wraps around, so this implementation will work properly.
