CodeGeneration:
```python
def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.
    '''
    n = float(value)
    
    # Check if the number is exactly halfway between two integers
    if abs(n - int(n)) == 0.5:
        # Round away from zero
        if n > 0:
            return int(n) + 1
        else:
            return int(n) - 1
    else:
        # Use standard rounding for other cases
        return round(n)
```

This implementation:
1. Converts the string input to a float
2. Checks if the number is exactly halfway between two integers by comparing the fractional part to 0.5
3. For exactly halfway cases, rounds away from zero (up for positive numbers, down for negative numbers)
4. Uses standard Python rounding for all other cases

The solution handles both positive and negative numbers correctly according to the specification, including the special case of equidistant values where it rounds away from zero.
