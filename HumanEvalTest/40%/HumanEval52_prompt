The following is chain of thought:
We are checking if ALL numbers in the list are below the threshold t.
 We can iterate through each number in the list and check if any number is >= t.
 If we find any number that is >= t, we can return False immediately.
 If we go through the entire list without finding any such number, we return True.

 Steps:
 1. For each number in the list l:
 2.   If number >= t, return False (because we f
