The following is chain of thought:
We are given two strings of '0's and '1's. We need to perform a binary XOR operation on each corresponding pair of bits.
 Steps:
 1. Check that the strings have the same length? (The problem doesn't specify, but the example has same length. We assume same length.)
 2. Iterate over each index in the strings.
 3. For each index, compare the two bits. XOR is true (1) i
