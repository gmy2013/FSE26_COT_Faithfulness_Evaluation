    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression

    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

The following is chain of thought:
We are given two fractions as strings: x and n, each in the form "numerator/denominator".
 We need to check if the product x * n is a whole number (integer).

 Steps:
 1. Split each fraction string to get numerator and denominator as integers.
 2. For x: split by '/' to get num_x and den_x.
 3. For n: split by '/' to get num_n and den_n.
 4. The product x * n = (num_x * num_n) / (den_x * den_n).
 5. We need to check if (num_x * num_n) is divisible by (den_x * den_n). 
    That is, (num_x * num_n) % (den_x * den_n) == 0.
 6. However, note: we can also reduce the fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by their gcd to avoid large numbers?
    But since we are only checking divisibility, we can compute the product and then check modulo.

 But caution: if we compute the product of numerators and denominators, the numbers might be large? 
 However, the problem says both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers. We can handle with integer arithmetic.

 Alternate approach: 
   We can write the product as (num_x * num_n) / (den_x * den_n). 
   To be an integer, the denominator (den_x * den_n) must divide the numerator (num_x * num_n).

 However, we can also simplify by canceling common factors between the numerator and denominator to avoid large numbers?
 But the problem does not require the simplified fraction, only whether the result is integer.

 Since the numbers are positive integers, we can compute:
   numerator_product = num_x * num_n
   denominator_product = den_x * den_n

 Then check if numerator_product is divisible by denominator_product.

 But note: it is possible that the fraction can be simplified by gcd. However, for divisibility, we can also do:
   if numerator_product % denominator_product == 0: then it's integer.

 However, we must be cautious: if we compute the product, the numbers might be large? But the problem says "positive whole numbers", which are integers.

 But to avoid potential overflow (though in Python integers are arbitrary precision, but for efficiency we might simplify first) we can reduce by gcd.

 Actually, we can reduce the fraction step by step:

   Let num = num_x * num_n
   Let den = den_x * den_n

   Then we can compute g = gcd(num, den) and then reduce the fraction to (num/g) / (den/g). Then we check if the denominator becomes 1.

 However, we don't need the reduced fraction, only whether the denominator becomes 1. Alternatively, we can check if den divides num.

 But note: we can also avoid building the large product by simplifying cross factors.

 Another efficient method:

   We have: (num_x/den_x) * (num_n/den_n) = (num_x * num_n) / (den_x * den_n)

   We can break down the factors:

   Let a = num_x, b = den_x, c = num_n, d = den_n.

   Then we need to check if (a*c) is divisible by (b*d).

   We can simplify by checking if (a * c) % (b * d) == 0.

 However, to avoid large numbers, we can simplify by canceling common factors between numerator and denominator.

 We can do:

   Let g1 = gcd(a, d)   -> cancel between first numerator and second denominator
   Let g2 = gcd(c, b)   -> cancel between second numerator and first denominator

   Then we can set:
