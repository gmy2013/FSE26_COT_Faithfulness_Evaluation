def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

    Example 1:

        Input: 3
        Output: (1, 2)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.

    Example 2:

        Input: 12
        Output: (4, 6)
        Explanation:
        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.

    Note:
        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:

1. We need to count all integer palindromes in the range [1, n] (inclusive).
2. For each palindrome number, check if it's even or odd.
3. Return a tuple (count_even, count_odd).

Approach:
- Iterate through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
- For each number, check if it's a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing with its r
