The following is chain of thought:
We are filtering a list of strings to only include those that contain the given substring.
 We can use a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the input list.
 For each string, we check if the substring is present using the `in` operator.
 If the substring is found in the string, we include that string in the result list.
 The function should return the filtered list.

 Let's implement this step by step:
 1. Create an empty list to store the results (or
