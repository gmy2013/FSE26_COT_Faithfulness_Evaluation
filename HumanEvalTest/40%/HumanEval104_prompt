The following is chain of thought:
We are given a list of positive integers. We need to return a sorted list (in increasing order) of those numbers that do not contain any even digit (i.e., all digits are odd).

Steps:
1. Iterate over each number in the input list.
2. For each number, convert it to a string to examine each digit.
3. Check if every digit (character) in that string is odd. Note: a digit is even if it is divisible by 2. So we can
