The following is chain of thought:
Looking at the problem, I need to find if there are two distinct elements that sum to zero. This means for each number, I need to check if its negative counterpart exists in the list.

Let me think through the approach:
1. I'll iterate through each element in the list
2. For each element, I'll check if its negative exists in the remaining elements
3. I need to ensure they're distinct (different indices)
4. If I find such a pair, return True immediately
5. If no pair is found after checking all, return False

The time complexity will be O(nÂ²) with nested loops, but I can optimize by using a set for O(n) time complexity.

Wait, let me consider the set approach:
1. Create an empty set to store seen numbers
2. F
