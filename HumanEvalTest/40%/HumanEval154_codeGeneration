CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the chain of thought:

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word
    cycpattern_check("abcd","abd") => False
    cycpattern_check("hello","ell") => True
    cycpattern_check("whassup","psus") => False
    cycpattern_check("abab","baa") => True
    cycpattern_check("efef","eeff") => False
    cycpattern_check("himenss","simen") => True
    """
    # Handle edge case where b is empty
    if not b:
        return True
    
    # Generate all rotations of b by concatenating b with itself
    doubled_b = b + b
    n = len(b)
    
    # Check each rotation (avoid duplicates by only checking first n rotations)
    for i in range(n):
        rotation = doubled_b[i:i+n]
        if rotation in a:
            return True
    
    return False
```

**Explanation:**
- We first handle the edge case where `b` is empty (an empty string is always a substring)
- We create `doubled_b = b + b` to easily generate all rotations
- We iterate through each possible starting position `i` from 0 to `len(b)-1`
- For each position, we extract a substring of length `len(b)` from `doubled_b`
- We check if this rotation exists as a substring in `a`
- If any rotation is found, we immediately return `True`
- If no rotations are found after checking all possibilities, we return `False`

This approach efficiently checks all possible rotations without generating duplicate checks, and handles all the test cases correctly.
