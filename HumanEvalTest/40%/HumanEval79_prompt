def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a decimal number and need to convert it to binary, then wrap it with 'db' at both ends.
 Steps:
 1. Convert the decimal number to binary without the '0b' prefix.
 2. Format the binary string by adding 'db' at the beginning and the end.
 3. Return the resulting string.

 However, note: the examples show that for 15 we get "db1111db", meaning we don't have leading zeros
