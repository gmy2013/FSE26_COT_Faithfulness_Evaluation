def even_odd_count(num):
    """Given an integer. return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.

     Example:
        even_odd_count(-12) ==> (1, 1)
        even_odd_count(123) ==> (1, 2)
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:
1. We need to count even and odd digits in an integer (could be negative).
2. We'll convert the number to a string to process each digit.
3. For each digit character, convert to integer and check if it's even or odd.
4. Ignore the negative sign if present (since it's not a digit).
5. Return a tuple (even_count, odd_count).

Steps:
- Convert num to string to handle each digit.
- If the number is negative, we sk
