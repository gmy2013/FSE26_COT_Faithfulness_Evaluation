The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to compute two values: the sum and the product of all integers in the list.
2. For an empty list:
   - The sum should be 0 (as stated: "empty sum should be equal to 0")
   - The product should be 1 (as stated: "empty product should be equal to 1")
3. For non-empty lists:
   - Sum: iterate through all numbers and add them together.
   - Product: iterate through all numbers and multi
