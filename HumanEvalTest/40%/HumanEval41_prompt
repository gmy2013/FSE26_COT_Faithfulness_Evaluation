def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To determine the number of collisions, note that each left-to-right car will collide with every right-to-left car that it meets. Since the cars are moving at the same speed and start far apart, each pair consisting of one left-to-right car and one right-to-left car will eventually meet and collide exactly once. The number of such pairs is the product of the number of cars in each group. Since there are n cars in each group, the total number of collisions is n * n = nÂ².
