CodeGeneration:
Looking at the problem again, I notice I misunderstood the bucket mechanism. Let me re-read:

"Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, and all buckets have the same capacity."

This means we have one dedicated bucket for each well. So we need to calculate trips for each well independently, then sum them up.

However, the examples suggest this interpretation is correct:
- Example 1: [0,0,1,0] (1 unit) + [0,1,0,0] (1 unit) + [1,1,1,1] (4 units) = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 trips with capacity 1
- Example 2: [0,0,1,1] (2 units) + [0,0,0,0] (0 units) + [1,1,1,1] (4 units) + [0,1,1,1] (3 units) = ceil(2/2) + ceil(0/2) + ceil(4/2) + ceil(3/2) = 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 5

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    """
    You are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row represents a single well,
    and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water.
    Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, 
    and all buckets have the same capacity.
    Your task is to use the buckets to empty the wells.
    Output the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

    Example 1:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 1
        Output: 6

    Example 2:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]
            bucket_capacity : 2
        Output: 5
    
    Example 3:
        Input: 
            grid : [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]
            bucket_capacity : 5
        Output: 0

    Constraints:
        * all wells have the same length
        * 1 <= grid.length <= 10^2
        * 1 <= grid[:,1].length <= 10^2
        * grid[i][j] -> 0 | 1
        * 1 <= capacity <= 10
    """
    total_trips = 0
    
    for row in grid:
        # Count the number of water units in this well
        water_units = sum(row)
        
        # Calculate number of bucket trips needed for this well
        if water_units > 0:
            trips = math.ceil(water_units / capacity)
            total_trips += trips
    
    return total_trips
