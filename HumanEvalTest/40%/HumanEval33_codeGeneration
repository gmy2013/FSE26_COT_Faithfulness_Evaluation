CodeGeneration:
To implement this function, we can create a list of the values at indices divisible by 3, sort them, and then build the result list by replacing those indices with the sorted values while keeping other elements unchanged.

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Extract values at indices divisible by 3
    divisible_by_three = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    # Sort these values
    sorted_values = sorted(divisible_by_three)
    # Create result list
    result = []
    sorted_index = 0
    for i, value in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(sorted_values[sorted_index])
            sorted_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(value)
    return result
```
