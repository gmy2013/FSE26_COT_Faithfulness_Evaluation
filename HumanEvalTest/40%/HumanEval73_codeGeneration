CodeGeneration:
Steps:
1. Initialize a counter for changes to 0.
2. Use two pointers: one starting at the beginning (left) and one at the end (right) of the array.
3. Traverse towards the center, comparing the elements at the left and right pointers.
4. If they are not equal, increment the change counter.
5. Move the pointers inward until they meet.
6. Return the total count of changes.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """
    n = len(arr)
    changes = 0
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left < right:
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            changes += 1
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return changes
```

This solution efficiently checks each symmetric pair and counts the mismatches, which directly gives the minimum number of changes needed. The time complexity is O(n/2) = O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).
