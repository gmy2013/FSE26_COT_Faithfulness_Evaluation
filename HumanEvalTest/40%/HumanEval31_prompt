The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. We need to handle edge cases: numbers less than 2 are not prime.
3. For numbers 2 and above, we need to check divisibility by integers from 2 up to the square root
