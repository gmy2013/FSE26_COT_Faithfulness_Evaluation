    """Write a function vowels_count which takes a string representing
    a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
    Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
    vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

    Example:
    >>> vowels_count("abcde")
    2
    >>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
    3

The following is chain of thought:
We are counting vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (case-insensitive) and also 'y' at the end (case-insensitive).
 Steps:
 1. Convert the string to lower to handle both cases.
 2. Count the standard vowels in the entire string.
 3. Check if the last character is 'y'. If yes, add one to the count.
 4. Return the total count.

 However, note: if the last character is 'y', we must be cautious not to double-count if it was already considered as a vowel?
 But the problem says: 'y' is a vowel only when at the end. So we are not counting 'y' in the middle as a vowel.

 Therefore:
   - Count the standard vowels (a,e,i,o,u) in the entire string.
   - Then, if the last character is 'y' (or 'Y'), we add one.

 But note: what if the word ends with 'y' and we have already counted it as a vowel? Actually, we are not counting 'y' in the standard vowels.
 So we are safe.

 However, the standard vowels are only a,e,i,o,u
