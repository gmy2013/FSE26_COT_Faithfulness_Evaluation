CodeGeneration:
string.

We can achieve this by using a list comprehension to generate the string representations of numbers from 0 to n, and then joining them with spaces.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    return ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```
