The following is chain of thought:
We are to implement a function that returns the length of a string.
 Since we cannot use the built-in len() function, we need to count the characters manually.
 We can iterate through the string and count each character until we reach the end.
 Alternatively, we can use a while loop until we hit an empty character (but note: in Python, strings are not null-terminated).
 Actually, the most straightforward way without using len() is to use a counter and a for loop.

 Steps:
 1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
 2. Iterate over each character in the string.
 3. Fo
