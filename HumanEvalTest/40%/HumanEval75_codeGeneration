```

This implementation:
1. First checks if `a` is less than 8 (the smallest possible product of three primes)
2. Generates all prime numbers up to `a` using a simple prime checking algorithm
3. Uses three nested loops to check all combinations of three primes (with repetition allowed)
4. Includes optimizations to break early when the product exceeds `a`
5. Returns True if any combination matches `a`, False otherwise

The solution efficiently handles all cases for numbers less than 100 by leveraging the small input size and early termination optimizations.
