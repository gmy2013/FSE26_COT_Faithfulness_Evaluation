CodeGeneration:
I'll implement the function to find the largest prime factor by dividing out all smaller factors first, which will leave the largest prime factor at the end.

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    # Divide out all factors of 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
        # If n becomes 1, then 2 was the largest prime factor
        if n == 1:
            return 2
    
    # Now check odd factors starting from 3
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            n //= factor
            # If n becomes 1, current factor is the largest
            if n == 1:
                return factor
        factor += 2
    
    # If we reach here, n is prime and is the largest factor
    return n
```

This implementation:
1. First handles all factors of 2 separately
2. Then checks odd factors starting from 3, incrementing by 2
3. Divides out each factor completely before moving to the next
4. Returns immediately when n becomes 1 (indicating the last factor was the largest)
5. Returns n if it remains greater than 1 after checking all factors up to âˆšn

The algorithm efficiently finds the largest prime factor by systematically eliminating all smaller factors first.
