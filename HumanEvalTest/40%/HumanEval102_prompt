def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:
1. We need to find the largest even integer in the range [x, y] inclusive.
2. If x > y, there are no numbers in the range, so return -1.
3. If there are numbers but no even numbers, return -1.
4. Otherwise, return the largest even number.

Approach:
- First, check if x > y -> return -1.
- We want the largest even number, so we should start from y and go backwards.
- The largest even number <= y is y if y is even, otherwise y-1.
- But we must ensure this number is >= x.
- So if y is even and y >= x, then y is our answer.
- If y is odd and y-1 >= x, then y-1 is our answer.
- Otherwise, there is no even number in the range, return -1.

However, we must consider that if y is odd and y-1 < x, then th
