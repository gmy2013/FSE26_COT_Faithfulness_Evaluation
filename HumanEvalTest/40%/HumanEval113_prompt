The following is chain of thought:
We are given a list of strings `lst`, each string contains only digits.
 For each string in the list, we need to count the number of odd digits (i.e., digits that are 1,3,5,7,9).
 Then, we need to form a string: "the number of odd elements Xn the strXng X of the Xnput." 
 However, note that in the example, the letter 'i' is replaced by the count (but also note that in the example output, the letter 'i' is replaced by the count in multiple places).
 Actually, looking at the examples:
   For the first example: input has one string with 4 odd digits -> output uses 4 to replace every occurrence of the letter 'i'?
   But wait: the output says "4n" (instead of "in"), "str4ng" (instead of "string"), "4nput" (instead of "input").
   So the rule is: in the template string, every occurrence of the letter 'i' (case sensitive? but the examples are all lowercase) should be replaced by the count (which is an integer, but we use its string representation).

 Steps for each string s in the input list:
  1. Count the number of odd digits in s: for each char in s, if int(char) % 2 == 1, then it's odd.
  2. Let n = that count (as an integer).
  3. Create the output string: 
        template = "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
        But we need to replace every 'i' in the template with the string representation of n.
  4. However, note: the examples show that every 'i' is replaced, even in words like "in", "string", "input".

 Implementation for one string:
   n = count_odd(s)
   result_string = template.replace('i', str(n))

 But wait: the template has the word "i" (which is the placeholder) and also other i's. So we replace all 'i' with the number.

 However, note the example: 
   For n=4: output is "the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."
   So indeed, every 'i' is replaced.

 But what if the count is 0? Then we replace every 'i' with '0'. That would be correct.
