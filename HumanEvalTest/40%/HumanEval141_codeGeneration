CodeGeneration:
he extension is one of the allowed ones.
- Check the digit count in the entire file name.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    # Check if there is exactly one dot
    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'
    
    # Split into base and extension
    parts = file_name.split('.')
    base = parts[0]
    extension = parts[1]
    
    # Check base name: not empty and starts with a letter
    if len(base) == 0 or not base[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    
    # Check extension is one of the allowed ones
    if extension not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']:
        return 'No'
    
    # Check digit count (no more than three digits)
    digit_count = sum(1 for char in file_name if char.isdigit())
    if digit_count > 3:
        return 'No'
    
    return 'Yes'
```
