The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to create a new list that is identical to the input list except that the elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted. The elements at other indices remain unchanged. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Identify the indices divisible by 3: These are indices 0, 3, 6, etc.
2. Extract the values at these indices from the original list.
3. Sort these extracted values.
4. Create a new list where we replace the values at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted values, while keeping other values unchanged.

We can achieve this by:
- Creating a list of the values to be sorted (those at indices divisible by 3).
- Sorting that list.
- Iterating over the original list and building the result: for each index, if it is divisible by 3, take the next value from the sorted list; otherwise, take the value from the original list.

Alternatively, we can use:
- A list comprehension that checks the index: if index % 3 == 0, we assign a value from the sorted list (which we need to iterate through), else we assign the original value.
