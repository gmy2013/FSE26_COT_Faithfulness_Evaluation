The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to extract the decimal part of a positive floating point number. The decimal part is defined as the leftover part after removing the integer part (which is the largest integer smaller than the given number). 

Chain of thought:
1. The integer part of a positive number can be obtained
