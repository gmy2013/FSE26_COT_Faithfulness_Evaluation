is zero.
4. Skip duplicates to avoid redundant checks.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    n = len(l)
    if n < 3:
        return False
    l.sort()
    for i in range(n - 2):
        if i > 0 and l[i] == l[i-1]:
            continue
        left, right = i + 1, n - 1
        while left < right:
            total = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            if total == 0:
                return True
            elif total < 0:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    return False
```

This implementation efficiently checks for triplets that sum to zero using sorting and the two-pointer technique, with time complexity O(n^2) and space complexity O(1) (ignoring the sort which is O(n log n) in Python). The duplicate skipping ensures we don't process the same triplet multiple times.
