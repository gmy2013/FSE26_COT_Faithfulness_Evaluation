def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. The function needs to count numbers that are greater than 10 and have both first and last digits odd.
2. For negative numbers, we need to consider the absolute value when checking digits since the sign doesn't affect digit oddness.
3. Convert each number to a string to easily access the first and last digits.
4. For negative numbers, remove the '-' sign before checking digits.
5. Check if both the first and last digits are odd (in '13579').
6. Also ensure the number is greater than 10
