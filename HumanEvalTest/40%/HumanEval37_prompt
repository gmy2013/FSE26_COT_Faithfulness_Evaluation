The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to sort the values at even indices in the list while leaving the values at odd indices unchanged. The even indices are those with an index value that is even (0-indexed: 0, 2, 4, ...).

Chain of thought:
1. Extract the values at even indices from the original list.
2. Sort these extracted values.
3. Create a new list where we place the sorted values back into the even indices, while keeping the odd indices unchanged from the original list.

Steps in code:
- We can create a list of the even-indexed elements by slicing the list with step 2 (starting at index 0).
- Sort this list.
- Iterate over the original list and for each even index, assign the next value from the sorted list.
- Alternatively, we can create a copy of the original list and then replace the even indices with the sor
