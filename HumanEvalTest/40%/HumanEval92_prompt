    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False

The following is chain of thought:
We are given three numbers: x, y, z.
 We need to check if all are integers. If any is not an integer, return False.
 Then, we need to check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.
 There are three possibilities:
   x == y + z
   y == x + z
   z == x + y
 If
