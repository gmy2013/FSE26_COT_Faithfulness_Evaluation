    Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing

    Return None if the values are equal.
    Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,

The following is chain of thought:
We are comparing two values that can be integers, floats, or strings representing numbers (with either '.' or ',' as decimal separator).
 Steps:
 1. Convert both inputs to a common numeric type (float) for comparison, handling the string cases appropriately.
 2. If the numeric values are equal, return None.
 3. Otherwise, return the original value (a or b) that corresponds to the larger numeric value.

 How to handle string conversion?
   - If the value is a string, replace any comma with a dot to handle both decimal separators, then convert to float.
   - If it's already a number (int or float), we can directly use it.

 However, note: we must return the original variable (with its original type and representation) of the larger one.

 Implementation:
   Define a helper function to convert any input to a float for comparison.

   Example: 
      For a string "5,1" -> replace ',' with '.' -> "5.1" -> float(5.1)
      For a string "6" -> it becomes float(6.0)

   Then compare the two floats.

   If they are equal, return None.

   Else, we need to return the original value (a or b) that is larger.

 Important: We must be cautious with floating point precision? But the problem says "real numbers", and the examples are simple.

 Let's code accordingly.
