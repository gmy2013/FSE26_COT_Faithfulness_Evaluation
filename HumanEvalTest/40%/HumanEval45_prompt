def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """

The following is chain of thought:
I need to implement a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (a) and the height (h). The formula for triangle area is (base Ã— height) / 2.

Looking at the docstring example: triangle_area(5, 3) should return 7.5.
