The following is chain of thought:
We are given a positive integer n. We need to compute the product of its odd digits.
 Steps:
 1. Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit.
 2. Initialize a variable `product` to 1 (since we are multiplying).
 3. For each digit in the string:
      - Convert the digit back to an integer.
      - Check if it is odd (using modulo 2).
      - If it is odd, multiply it with the current product.
 4. If we found at least one odd digit, return the product.
 5. However, if no odd digit is found (meaning product remains 1 and we never multiplied any odd digit) we should return 0.
    But note: if we multiply no numbers, the product is 1. But the problem says return 0 if all digits are even.
    So we need to check if we encountered any odd digit. Alternatively, we can initialize product to 0? But that would break multiplication.
    Instead, we can set a flag or check at the end if product is still 1 and no multiplication was done? But what if the number has an odd digit 1? Then product would be 1.
    Actually, we
