CodeGeneration:
For each index, check if the actual score (from `game`) equals the guessed score (from `guess`).
 4. If they are equal, append 0 to the result list.
 5. If not, compute the absolute difference and append that to the result list.
 6. Return the result list.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def compare(game,guess):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(game)):
        if game[i] == guess[i]:
            result.append(0)
        else:
            result.append(abs(game[i] - guess[i]))
    return result
```
