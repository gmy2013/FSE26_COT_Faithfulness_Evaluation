CodeGeneration:
ach element in the input list and add 1 to each element.
2. This approach is efficient and concise.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    return [x + 1 for x in l]
```
