    """You have to write a function which validates a given date string and
    returns True if the date is valid otherwise False.
    The date is valid if all of the following rules are satisfied:
    1. The date string is not empty.
    2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
    3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
    4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

    for example: 
    valid_date('03-11-2000') => True

    valid_date('15-01-2012') => False

    valid_date('04-0-2040') => False

    valid_date('06-04-2020') => True

    valid_date('06/04/2020') => False
    """

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Check if the date string is empty -> return False if empty.
2. Check the format: it must be exactly in "mm-dd-yyyy" format with dashes as separators.
   - Split the string by '-'. There should be exactly 3 parts.
   - Each part should be composed of digits only.
3. Check the month: must be between 1 and 12.
4. Check the day based on the month:
   - For months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12: days between 1 and 31.
   - For months 4,6,9,11: days between 1 and 30.
   - For month 2: days between 1 and 29.
5. Also, we should check that the day and month parts have exactly 2 digits and the year has exactly 4 digits? The examples don't explicitly require this, but note:
   - '04-0-2040' is invalid (day has only one digit) and '06/04/2020' is invalid (wrong separator). So we must enforce the format with two-digit month and day and four-digit year? Actually, the examples show:
        '03-11-2000' (valid) has two-digit month, two-digit day, four-digit year.
        '15-01-2012' (invalid because month 15 is invalid) but also has two-digit month and day.
        '04-0-2040' (invalid) has one-digit day.
        '06-04-2020' (valid) has two-digit month and day.
   So the function should require two digits for month and day and four digits for year? The docstring says "format: mm-dd-yyyy", which impli
