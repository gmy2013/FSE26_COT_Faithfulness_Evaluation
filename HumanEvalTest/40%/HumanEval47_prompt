The following is chain of thought:
To implement the median function, we need to:
1. Sort the input list to arrange elements in ascending order
2. Find the middle index/indices based on whether the list length is odd or even
3. For odd length: return the middle element
4. For even length: return the average of the two middle elements

Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, sort the list using sorted() to avoid modifying the original list
2. Calculate the l
