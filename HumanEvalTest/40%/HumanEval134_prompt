    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:
1. We need to check if the last character is an alphabetical character (a-z or A-Z)
2. And it must not be part of a word (meaning it should be preceded by a space or be the only character)
3. If the string is empty, return False
4. If the last character is a space, return False

Approach:
- First, check if the string is empty -> return False
- Check if last character is alphabetical using isalpha()
- If it's alphabetical, we need to check if it's not part of a word:
  - If it's the only character in the string -> True
  - If the character before it is a space -> True
  - Otherwise, it's part of a word -> False
- If last character is not alphabetical -> return Fa
