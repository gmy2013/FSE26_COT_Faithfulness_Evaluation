CodeGeneration:
I see the confusion. The problem defines the length as (end - start), not counting the number of integers. For a closed interval [start, end], the length is (end - start). This is consistent with the example where (2,3) has length 1.

Let me implement the solution:

```python
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """You are given two intervals,
    where each interval is a pair of integers. For example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2).
    The given intervals are closed which means that the interval (start, end)
    includes both start and end.
    For each given interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end.
    Your task is to determine whether the length of intersection of these two 
    intervals is a prime number.
    Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
    which its length is 1, which not a prime number.
    If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES",
    otherwise, return "NO".
    If the two intervals don't intersect, return "NO".


    [input/output] samples:
    intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) ==> "NO"
    intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) ==> "YES"
    """
    
    # Find the intersection
    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    
    # Check if intervals intersect
    if start > end:
        return "NO"
    
    # Calculate length of intersection
    length = end - start
    
    # Check if length is prime
    if length < 2:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check for prime number
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return "NO"
    
    return "YES"
```

The implementation:
1. Finds the intersection using max(start1, start2) and min(end1, end2)
2. Returns "NO" if there's no intersection
3. Calculates the length as end - start
4. Checks if the length is prime (numbers less than 2 are not prime)
5. Uses trial division up to √n to check for primality
6. Returns "YES" if prime, "NO" otherwise

Let me test with the provided examples:
- (1,2) and (2,3): intersection is (2,2), length = 0 → "NO" ✓
- (-1,1) and (0,4): intersection is (0,1), length = 1 → "NO" ✓  
- (-3,-1) and (-5,5): intersection is (-3,-1), length = 2 → prime → "YES" ✓
