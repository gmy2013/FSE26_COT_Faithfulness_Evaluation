CodeGeneration:
er is a letter, we reverse its case (using `swapcase()`).
   - Otherwise, we keep it as is.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def solve(s):
    if not any(c.isalpha() for c in s):
        return s[::-1]
    
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            result.append(char.swapcase())
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)
```
