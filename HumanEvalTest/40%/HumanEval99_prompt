def closest_integer(value):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number
    and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant
    from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15

    Note:
    Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
    from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
    farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
    return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:

1. Convert the string input to a float to handle both integers and decimals.
2. We need to round to the nearest integer, but with a special rule for .5 cases: round away from zero.
3. Standard Python rounding (round()) uses "round half to even" which rounds to the nearest even integer for .5 cases.
4. We need different behavior: for positive numbers, .5 should round up; for negative numbers, .5 should round down.
5. We can implement this by checking if the fractional part is exactly 0.5 (or -0.5 for negatives).
6. If it is exactly 0.5, we round up for positive, down for negative.
7. Otherwise, we can use normal rounding.

However, note: we must be cautious with floating point precision when checking for exactly 0.5.

Alternatively, we can use:
   - For positive numbers: if the fractional part >= 0.5, round up; else round down.
   - For negative numbers: if the fractional part <= -0.5, round down; else round up.

But wait: the problem says "equidistant from two integers" which only happens at exactly .5. So we need to detect exactly .5.

But due to floating point issues, we might not get exactly 0.5. So we can check if the absolute difference between the value and (integer part + 0.5) is very small.

Alternatively, we can avoid floating point by working with the string representation? But the problem says the input is a string representing a number.

Another idea: use the decimal module for exact representation? But the problem doesn't require that.

Alternatively, we can do:

   n = float(value)
   integer_part = int(n)
   fractional = n - integer_part

But for negative numbers, integer_part is rounded towards zero. So for negative n, inte
