    """Given a string s and a natural number n, you have been tasked to implement 
    a function that returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly 
    n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.
    If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty list.
    Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
    Examples:
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> ["little"]
    select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> ["Mary", "lamb"]
    select_words("simple white space", 2) ==> []
    select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> ["world"]
    select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> ["Uncle"]
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To implement this function, we need to:
1. Split the input string into words.
2. For each word, count the number of consonants (non-vowels).
3. Check if the consonant count equals n.
4. Collect all such words in the order they appear.

Let's break down the steps:
- Define what vowels are: 'aeiou' (and we should consider both lowercase and uppercase).
- For each word, convert to lowercase to handle case insensitivity when checking vowels.
- Count consonants: any lett
