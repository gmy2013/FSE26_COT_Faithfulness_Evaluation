CodeGeneration:
using the `int()` function, which truncates towards zero. Since the number is positive, this will give the largest integer smaller than the number.
2. Subtract this integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
3. Return the decimal part.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    integer_part = int(number)
    return number - integer_part
```
