def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if n > m: if true, return -1 immediately.
2. Calculate the average of integers from n to m inclusive: use (n + m) / 2.0 for floating point division.
3. Round the average to the nearest integer: use round() function.
