The following is chain of thought:
To determine if a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, note that each even number must be at least 2. Therefore, the smallest possible sum is 2+2+2+2=8. So, if `n < 8`, it is impossible.

Since all numbers are even, their sum must be even. So, if `n` is odd, it cannot be expressed as such.

For even `n >= 8`, we can always represent it as
