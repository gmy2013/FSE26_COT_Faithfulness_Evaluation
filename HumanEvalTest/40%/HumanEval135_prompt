    """Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain

    Examples:

The following is chain of thought:
We are to find the largest index i (with i >= 1) such that arr[i] <= arr[i-1]. 
 Since the array has no duplicates, "not greater than or equal to" means strictly less.
 So we are looking for indices i where arr[i] < arr[i-1].
 We want the largest index (i.e., the rightmost occurrence) where this happens.
 If no such index exists, return -1.

 Approach:
 Iterate from the end of the array backwards (from last index to index 1) and check the condition.
 As soon as we find an index
