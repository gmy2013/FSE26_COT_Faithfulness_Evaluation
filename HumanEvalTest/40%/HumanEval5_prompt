The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem:
1. If the list is empty, return an empty list.
2. For a non-empty list, we need to insert the delimeter between every two elements.
3. The result should start with the first element, then delimeter, then second element, then delimeter, and so on until the last element (which shouldn't be followed by a delimeter).

Approach:
- Initialize an empty result lis
