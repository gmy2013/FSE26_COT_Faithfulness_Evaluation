    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a string that may have words separated by commas or spaces (or both).
 We need to split the string into words and return a list of these words.
 Since the separators can be commas or spaces, we can replace commas with spaces and then split by space.
 Alternatively, we can split by both commas and spaces. However, note that there might be multiple spaces or commas.
 We can use a regular expression to split by any sequence of commas and/or spaces.
 But a simpler approach is to replace commas with spaces and then use split() which handles multiple spaces.

 Steps:
 1. Replace all commas in the string with spaces.
 2. Then split
