CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation of the `factorize` function:

```python
from typing import List
import math


def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
    factors = []
    
    # Handle the case when n is 1
    if n == 1:
        return []
    
    # Factor out all 2s
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    
    # Check for odd factors starting from 3
    # Only need to check up to sqrt(n)
    i = 3
    max_factor = math.isqrt(n)
    
    while i <= max_factor:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
            max_factor = math.isqrt(n)  # Update max_factor since n changed
        i += 2
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, it's a prime number
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors
```

This implementation follows the approach you outlined:
1. First factors out all 2s (the only even prime)
2. Then checks odd factors starting from 3 up to âˆšn
3. If n is still greater than 1 after this process, it means n itself is prime
4. Returns the list of factors in order from smallest to largest

The function handles edge cases like n=1 and ensures the product of all factors equals the original input number.
