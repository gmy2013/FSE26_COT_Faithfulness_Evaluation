The following is chain of thought:
To decode a string encoded with `encode_shift`, we need to reverse the encoding operation. The encoding shifted each character forward by 5 positions in the alphabet. Therefore, decoding requires shifting each character backward by 5 positions in the alphabet.

The encoding operation was:
`chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a"))`

To decode, we need to subtract 5 instead of adding 5. However, we must handle th
