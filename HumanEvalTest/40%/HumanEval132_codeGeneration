CodeGeneration:
bracket (B) after A,
        then a closing bracket (C) after B,
        then a closing bracket (D) after C.

   So the condition is: we need at least two '[' and two ']' with the second '[' appearing before the first ']'.

   Actually, wait: in the pattern "[[]]", the first closing bracket (C) closes the inner pair, and the second closing bracket (D) closes the outer pair. So the order of indices must be:
        A (first '[') at index i
        B (second '[') at index j (j>i)
        C (first ']') at index k (k>j)
        D (second ']') at index l (l>k)

   So the key is: we need to have at least two '[' that appear before at least two ']'.

   How to check this?
        Let open_indices = list of indices where '[' occurs
        Let close_indices = list of indices where ']' occurs

        We need to check if there are at least two open_indices and two close_indices, and
        the second open_indices (i.e., open_indices[1]) is less than the second last close_indices? Actually, we need the second open to be before the first close that has at least one close after it? 

   Alternatively, we can note: we need the second opening bracket to come before the second closing bracket (when considering the order of brackets). But wait: the closing brackets we use for the inner and outer pairs are the first two closing brackets? Not necessarily, because we can skip closing brackets.

   Actually, we can choose any two closing brackets. So we need to have two opening brackets that occur before two closing brackets, and the second opening bracket must occur before the first of those two closing brackets.

   More precisely: we need to find two opening brackets at indices i and j (i<j) and two closing brackets at indices k and l (k<l) such that j < k.

   Why? Because the inner opening (j) must be before the inner closing (k), and the outer opening (i) is before everything, and the outer closing (l) is after everything.

   So the condition is: there exists an index j (the second opening) that is less than some closing bracket k, and we have at least two opening and two closing brackets.

   But note: we can choose the closing brackets arbitrarily. So we can take the first two closing brackets that come after j? Actually, we need two closing brackets that come after j.

   Therefore, the algorithm:

        Count the number of '[' and ']'. If we have less than 2 of either, return False.

        Find the second occurrence of '[' (let its index be j).
        Find the first occurrence of ']' that comes after j (let its index be k). If there is no such k, return False.
        Now, we need one more closing bracket after k. So if there is at least one closing bracket after k, then we have found a nested structure.

        Why? Because we can take:
            the first '[' (which is before j),
            the second '[' (at j),
            the first closing after j (at k),
            and any closing after k (say at l).

        Then the subsequence: first '[', second '[', first closing after j, and closing at l forms "[[]]" with indices i < j < k < l.

   However, what if the first '[' is after some closing brackets? We don't care because we can skip those closing brackets. We are only concerned with the order of the brackets we choose.

   So the algorithm is:

        Let opens = [i for i, char in enumerate(string) if char == '[']
        Let closes = [i for i, char in enumerate(string) if char == ']']

        If len(opens) < 2 or len(closes) < 2:
            return False

        second_open = opens[1]   # the second occurrence of '['
        # Find the first closing bracket that comes after second_open
        # We can binary search in closes for the first index greater than second_open
        # Since closes is sorted, we can do:

        # If there is no closing bracket after second_open, then we cannot form the inner pair.
        if closes[-1] <= second_open:
            return False

        # Now, we need to find the first closing bracket that is > second_open.
        # We can iterate or use binary search.

        # Actually, we don't need the exact index, we just need to know if there are at least two closing brackets after second_open?
        # But note: we need two closing brackets: one for the inner and one for the outer.
        # The first closing after second_open can be the inner closing, and we need at least one more closing after that.

        # So: if the last closing bracket is greater than the first closing after second_open, then we have two.

        # How many closing brackets are after second_open?
        # We can count: let first_close_after = next((c for c in closes if c > second_open), None)
        # if first_close_after is not None and there is at least one closing bracket after first_close_after, then we have two.

        # Actually, since closes is sorted, we can do:
        # Find the first index in closes that is greater than second_open.
        low, high = 0, len(closes)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low+high)//2
            if closes[mid] <= second_open:
                low = mid+1
            else:
                high = mid
        # Now low is the index of the first closing bracket that is > second_open.
        if low < len(closes) - 1: 
            # meaning there are at least two closing brackets from index low onward (including low)
            return True
        else:
            return False

   However, note: we only need one more closing after the first one after second_open. So if low is the index of the first closing after second_open, then we need at least one more closing at index low+1.

   So condition: if low <= len(closes)-2, then we have at least two closing brackets after second_open.

   Let's test with examples:

        Example 1: '[[]]' 
            opens = [0,1] , closes = [2,3]
            second_open = 1
            We need to find the first closing > 1: that is closes[0]=2, so low=0.
            Then we need at least one more closing after index0: we have closes[1]=3, so low=0 <= len(closes)-2=0? Actually len(closes)=2, so len(closes)-2=0, and low=0 <=0 -> true. So returns True.

        Example 2: '[]]]]]]][[[[[]'
            This has many closing brackets first. Let's take a concrete string: suppose string = '[]]]]]]][[[[[]'
            Actually, the example is given as False.

            We need to count the opens and closes. The string has: 
                opens: occur at the end: let's index from0.
                The string: '[]]]]]]][[[[[]'
                Let's write indices: 
                  0: '[' -> open
                  1: ']' -> close
                  2: ']' -> close
                  3: ']' -> close
                  4: ']' -> close
                  5: ']' -> close
                  6: ']' -> close
                  7: '[' -> open
                  8: '[' -> open
                  9: '[' -> open
                  10: '[' -> open
                  11: '[' -> open
                  12: ']' -> close

            So opens = [0,7,8,9,10,11], closes = [1,2,3,4,5,6,12]
            second_open = 7.
            Now, we need to find the first closing >7: the closes that are >7 are [12] only. So the first closing after7 is at index6 in closes (value12). So low=6.
            Now, we need at least one more closing after index6? But there is none. So low=6 and len(closes)=7, so len(closes)-2=5, and 6>5 -> false. So returns False.

        Example 3: '[][]'
            string: '[', ']', '[', ']'
            opens = [0,2], closes = [1,3]
            second_open=2.
            First closing >2: the closes[1]=3>2, so low=1.
            Then we need one more closing after index1? There is none. So low=1, len(closes)=2, so len(closes)-2=0, and 1>0 -> false. Returns False.

        Example 4: '[[][]]' -> True
            opens = [0,1,3] , closes = [2,4,5]
            second_open=1.
            First closing >1: closes[0]=2>1, so low=0.
            Then we have two more closings at index1 and2? So low=0 <= len(closes)-2=1? 0<=1 -> true.

        Example 5: '[[]][[' -> True
            string: '[','[',']',']','[','['
            opens = [0,1,4,5], closes=[2,3]
            second_open=1.
            First closing >1: closes[0]=2>1, so low=0.
            Then we have one more closing at index1? So low=0 <= len(closes)-2=0? 0<=0 -> true.

   So the algorithm works.

   However, note: we are using the second open bracket. What if the first two opens are not the best? Actually, we are allowed to skip brackets arbitrarily. So we can choose any two opens. The second open is the earliest possible second open. If we can form a nested structure with the second open, then we are done. If not, then we cannot with any second open? Actually, if the second open is too late, then we might have a later open that works. But wait: we are using the second open because we want the inner open to be as early as possible to have more closing brackets after it.

   However, consider: 
        string: '[[[[]]' 
        This has nesting. But what if we have:
        string: '[[]' followed by many opens and then closings? Actually, we have already taken the second open which is the earliest possible. So it gives the best chance to have closings after.

   But what if the second open is too early and there are not enough closings, but a later open has enough? For example:
        string: '[[[]'   and then later we have ']]]' 
        Actually, the second open is at index1. The closings start after index1? But in this string, the closings are after the third open. So if we take the first open and the third open as the two opens, then we have closings after.

        However, note: we are allowed to skip the second open. So we can choose the first and the third open. Then we need two closings after the third open.

        So in the algorithm, we are only checking the second open. But we might need to check if there is any open that has at least two closings after it.

        Actually, the condition is: there exists an open bracket such that there are at least two closing brackets after it. And we also have an open bracket before it (to be the outer open).

        So we can do: 
            For each open bracket at index j (except the first one), we can check if there are two closing brackets after j.
            But we want the earliest j that satisfies this? Actually, we don't need to check all: if the second open doesn't work, then no open will work? Not necessarily: because a later open might have more closing brackets after it.

        Example: 
            string = '[ [ ] ] ] ] [ [ [ ] ] ]'
            The first few opens: at0, then at1. The closings: at2,3,4,5. Then opens at6,7,8, and closings at9,10,11.
            For the second open (index1), there are closings at2,3,4,5 -> four closings, so it should work.

        But consider a string where the second open has no closing, but a later open has:
            string: '[[[[]]' 
            This is balanced and nested. The opens:0,1,2,3. Closings:4,5.
            The second open is at1. There are two closings after1? Yes, at4 and5. So it works.

        Another counterexample? 
            string: '[[[[]'   # missing one closing for the outer pair? But we can still form a nested subsequence? 
            Actually, to form "[[]]" we need four brackets. In '[[[[]', we have four opens and one closing. We cannot form two pairs because we need two closings.

        So if a string has enough closings overall, but they are all after a later open, then the second open might not have enough, but a later open does.

        How about: 
            string: '[[[]]]'   # balanced and nested. The second open at index1 has closings at3,4,5 -> three closings, so it works.

        It seems that if there is any open that has at least two closings after it, and there is an open before it, then we can form a nested structure.

        Therefore, we can iterate over the opens (starting from the second open) and check if there are at least two closings after it.

        Algorithm:

            opens = list of indices of '['
            closes = list of indices of ']'

            if len(opens)<2 or len(closes)<2:
                return False

            for i in range(1, len(opens)):
                j = opens[i]   # current open bracket
                # find the first closing bracket after j
                low, high = 0, len(closes)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low+high)//2
                    if closes[mid] <= j:
                        low = mid+1
                    else:
                        high = mid
                # now low is the index of the first closing after j
                if low <= len(closes) - 2:
                    return True

            return False

        This will check every open bracket (except the first) to see if it has at least two closing brackets after it.

        Let's test with the previous examples.

        Example: '[]]]]]]][[[[[]' 
            opens = [0,7,8,9,10,11]
            For each open from index1 onward (7,8,9,10,11), we check:
                For open at7: first closing after7 is at index6 (value12), and there is no closing after index6 -> fails.
                Similarly for all others: the only closing is at12, so no open has two closings after it. Returns False.

        Example: '[][]'
            opens = [0,2]
            For open at2: first closing after2 is at index1 (value3), and there is no closing after index1 -> fails. Returns False.

        Example: '[[]][[' 
            opens = [0,1,4,5]
            For open at1: first closing after1 is at index0 (value2), and there are closings at index1 (value3) -> so low=0, and we have at least two closings from index0? Actually, from index0 we have two closings: index0 and index1. So low=0 <= len(closes)-2=0? len(closes)=2, so len(closes)-2=0, and 0<=0 -> true. Returns True.

        This seems correct.

        However, we can optimize: we don't need to iterate over all opens. We can stop at the first open that has two closings after it.

        Also, we can precompute the closes list and use binary search.

        Code implementation:

        We'll use the bisect module to do the binary search.

        Steps:
            import bisect
            opens = [i for i, char in enumerate(string) if char == '[']
            closes = [i for i, char in enumerate(string) if char == ']']

            if len(opens) < 2 or len(closes) < 2:
                return False

            for i in range(1, len(opens)):
                j = opens[i]
                # find the first index in closes that is greater than j
                pos = bisect.bisect_right(closes, j)   # returns the index where j would be inserted to maintain sorted order, but such that all values to the left are <=j.
                # actually, bisect_right returns the insertion position after the last element <=j.
                # So the first closing >j is at index = pos.
                if pos <= len(closes) - 2:
                    return True

            return False

        Let's test with bisect_right:
            closes = [1,2,3,4,5,6,12] and j=7.
            bisect_right(closes,7) returns the index where 7 would be inserted. Since all closes are <=7 until index5 (value6) and then value12>7, so the index returned is 6? Because after index5, we have index6:12>7. Actually, bisect_right returns the index after the last element that is <=7. The last element <=7 is6 at index5, so it returns 6.

            Then we check if 6 <= len(closes)-2 = 5 -> false.

        So it works.

        Alternatively, we can use bisect_left(closes, j+1) to find the first closing >= j+1.

        But using bisect_right is fine.

   Code:

        import bisect

        opens = []
        closes = []
        for index, char in enumerate(string):
            if char == '[':
                opens.append(index)
            else:  # char == ']'
                closes.append(index)

        if len(opens) < 2 or len(closes) < 2:
            return False

        for i in range(1, len(opens)):
            pos = bisect.bisect_right(closes, opens[i])
            if pos + 1 < len(closes):   # meaning there are at least two closings from index pos onward
                return True

        return False

   However, note: we need two closings after opens[i]. The first closing is at pos, and the second at pos
