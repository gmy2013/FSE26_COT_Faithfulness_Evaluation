CodeGeneration:
losing brackets than opening ones at that point, which is invalid, so we return False.
 After processing all brackets, if the counter is 0, it means all opening brackets were properly closed, so return True; otherwise, return False.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    count = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            count += 1
        elif char == ')':
            count -= 1
            if count < 0:
                return False
    return count == 0
```
