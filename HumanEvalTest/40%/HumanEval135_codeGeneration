CodeGeneration:
i where arr[i] < arr[i-1], we can return that index since we're going from the end and want the largest index.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    """Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
    duplicate values.

    Examples:
    can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1
    """
    # Iterate backwards from the last element to the second element
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            return i
    return -1
```

This implementation:
1. Starts from the end of the array and moves backwards
2. Checks if the current element is less than the previous element
3. Returns the index immediately when found (which will be the largest index)
4. Returns -1 if no such index is found after checking all positions
