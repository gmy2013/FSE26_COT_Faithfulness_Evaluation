    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the conditions for a valid file name:

1. There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the entire file name.
2. The file name must contain exactly one dot '.'.
3. The substring before the dot (the base name) must:
   - Not be empty.
   - Start with a Latin alphabet letter (a-z, A-Z).
4. The substring after the dot (the extension) must be one of: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].

We'll implement this step by step:
- First, check if there is exactly one dot in the string.
- Split the file name into base and extension using the dot.
- Check the base name: not empty and starts with a letter.
- Check t
