    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0

    If the input list is empty, return 0.

The following is chain of thought:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We need to process each element in the input list `lst`.
2. For each element, we must check:
   - If it is an integer (ignore non-integers)
   - If it is non-negative (ignore negatives)
   - If it is odd (only odd numbers contribute)
3. For numbers that satisfy all conditions, we square them.
4. Sum all these squares.
5. Return 0 if the list is empty.
