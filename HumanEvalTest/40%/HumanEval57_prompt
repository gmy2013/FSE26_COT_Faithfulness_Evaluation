The following is chain of thought:
We are checking if the list is either entirely non-decreasing or entirely non-increasing.
 Steps:
 1. Check if the list has less than 2 elements - always True.
 2. Determine the direction by comparing the first two distinct elements (if any).
 3. Once direction is known, check the rest of the list for consistency.

 However, note: we need to handle cases where there might be consecutive equal values (non-strict monotonicity).

 Approach:
 We can traverse the list and check for both conditions simultaneously.

 Alternatively, we can:
   Check if the list
