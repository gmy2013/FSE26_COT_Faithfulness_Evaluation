CodeGeneration:
Let's implement the function step by step:

1. For each string in the input list, count the number of odd digits.
2. For each count, generate the output string by replacing every occurrence of the letter 'i' with the string representation of the count.
3. Return the list of these generated strings.

Here's the code:

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

    >>> odd_count(['1234567'])
    ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
    >>> odd_count(['3',"11111111"])
    ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.",
     "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
    """
    result = []
    for s in lst:
        count = 0
        for char in s:
            if int(char) % 2 == 1:
                count += 1
        # Create the template string
        template = "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input."
        # Replace every 'i' with the string representation of count
        output_str = template.replace('i', str(count))
        result.append(output_str)
    return result
```

This code correctly processes each string in the input list, counts the odd digits, and generates the required output string by replacing all occurrences of 'i' with the count. The examples provided in the docstring should work as expected.
