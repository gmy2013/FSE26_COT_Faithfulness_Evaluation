CodeGeneration:
I see the issue in the chain of thought. The problem states that we need to use "the next odd number" if n is odd, and "the next even number" if n is even. This means we need to consider the parity of the current level, not just add 2 each time.

Let me correct this:
- If current level is odd, next level should be current + 2 (next odd)
- If current level is even, next level should be current + 2 (next even)

Wait, that's still the same result. Actually, both cases result in adding 2. Let me verify with the example:
- Level 1: 3 (odd) → Level 2: 5 (next odd, which is 3+2)
- Level 2: 5 (odd) → Level 3: 7 (next odd, which is 5+2)

So indeed, regardless of whether the current level is odd or even, we always add 2 to get to the next number of the same parity.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    pile = [n]
    for i in range(1, n):
        pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
    return pile
```
