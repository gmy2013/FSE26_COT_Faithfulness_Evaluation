CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation using fast exponentiation (exponentiation by squaring):

```python
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics).
    >>> modp(3, 5)
    3
    >>> modp(1101, 101)
    2
    >>> modp(0, 101)
    1
    >>> modp(3, 11)
    8
    >>> modp(100, 101)
    1
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    result = 1
    base = 2
    n_remaining = n
    
    while n_remaining > 0:
        if n_remaining % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * base) % p
        base = (base * base) % p
        n_remaining //= 2
    
    return result
```

This implementation:
1. Handles the base case where n = 0 (returns 1)
2. Uses exponentiation by squaring to efficiently compute large powers
3. Takes modulo p at each step to prevent integer overflow
4. Has time complexity O(log n), making it efficient even for large values of n

The algorithm works by breaking down the exponentiation into smaller squares and multiplications, always keeping the intermediate values within reasonable size by applying the modulo operation at each step.
