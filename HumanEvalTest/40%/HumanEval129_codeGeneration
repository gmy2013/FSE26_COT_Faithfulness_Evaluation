CodeGeneration:
I'll generate the Python code to solve this problem. Here's my approach:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]
    """
    n = len(grid)
    
    # Find the starting cell with minimum value
    min_val = float('inf')
    start_i, start_j = -1, -1
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] < min_val:
                min_val = grid[i][j]
                start_i, start_j = i, j
    
    # If k == 1, just return the minimum value
    if k == 1:
        return [min_val]
    
    # Directions: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # BFS approach to find the lexicographically smallest path
    # Each state: (path, i, j)
    # We need to find the path of length k with minimum lexicographical order
    
    # Start with the cell with minimum value
    queue = [([min_val], start_i, start_j)]
    
    for step in range(1, k):
        next_queue = []
        
        for path, i, j in queue:
            # Get all valid neighbors
            for di, dj in directions:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                
                if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:
                    new_path = path + [grid[ni][nj]]
                    next_queue.append((new_path, ni, nj))
        
        # Sort by path lexicographically and keep only the best candidates
        # Since the answer is unique, we can keep only the best path for each position
        best_paths = {}
        
        for path, i, j in next_queue:
            pos_key = (i, j)
            if pos_key not in best_paths or path < best_paths[pos_key][0]:
                best_paths[pos_key] = (path, i, j)
        
        queue = list(best_paths.values())
    
    # Find the lexicographically smallest path among all candidates
    result = min(queue, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    return result
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Find the starting cell**: We first locate the cell with the smallest value, as this will be the optimal starting point for a lexicographically smallest path.

2. **Handle k=1 case**: If we only need a path of length 1, we simply return the value of the starting cell.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We use BFS to explore all possible paths of length k:
   - We start from the cell with the smallest value
   - At each step, we expand to all valid neighboring cells
   - We maintain the current path for each position

4. **Optimization**: To avoid exponential growth, we only keep the lexicographically smallest path for each grid position at each step.

5. **Result extraction**: After k steps, we find the lexicographically smallest path among all candidates.

The algorithm ensures we find the minimum lexicographical path by always keeping only the best path for each position and expanding systematically through BFS.
