def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of changes required to make an array palindromic. A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards. The key insight is that for each pair of symmetric elements (i.e., the first and last, second and second last, etc.), if they are not equal, at least one change is required to make them match. However, since we can change any element to any value, we can always make a pair equal with exactly one change (by changing one of them to match the other). Therefore, for each mismatched pair, we count one change.
