    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a positive integer N (0 <= N <= 10000).
 Steps:
 1. Convert N to a string to iterate over each digit.
 2. Sum the integer values of each digit.
 3. Convert the sum to its binary representation without the '0b' prefix.
 4. Return the binary string.

 Example: 
   For N=1000, digits are '1','0','0','0' -> sum=1 -> binary is "1".
   For N=150, digits are '1','5','0' -> sum=6 -> binary is
