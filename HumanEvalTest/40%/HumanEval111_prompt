def histogram(test):
    """Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary
    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.
    If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.
    
    Example:
    histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
    histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}
    histogram('') == {}

    """

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to create a histogram (frequency count) of letters in a given string, and then return a dictionary containing only the letter(s) with the highest frequency along with their count(s). If multiple letters have the same highest frequency, all should be included.

**Approach:**
1. If the input string is empty, return an empty dictionary.
2. Split the string into a list of letters.
3. Count the frequency of each letter u
