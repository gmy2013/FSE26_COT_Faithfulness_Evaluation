CodeGeneration:
nt (for j from 0 to len(xs)-2) is (j+1) * xs[j+1].

Here is the implementation:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    """
    if len(xs) <= 1:
        return [0]
    
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        result.append(xs[i] * i)
    
    return result
```

Let's test it with the provided examples:
- For [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]: 
  - i=1: 1*1 = 1
  - i=2: 2*2 = 4
  - i=3: 4*3 = 12
  - i=4: 5*4 = 20
  - Result: [1, 4, 12, 20] ✓

- For [1, 2, 3]:
  - i=1: 2*1 = 2
  - i=2: 3*2 = 6
  - Result: [2, 6] ✓

The function handles edge cases like single-element lists (constants) by returning [0].
