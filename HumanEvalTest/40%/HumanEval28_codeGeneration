CodeGeneration:
the elements of the list with the string it's called on as the separator.
 Since we want no separator between the strings, we should call join on an empty string.
 Let's implement this.

```python
from typing import List


def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    return ''.join(strings)
```
