CodeGeneration:
To solve this problem, we need to find the largest prime number in a given list of integers and then return the sum of its digits. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Primes**: First, we need to check which numbers in the list are prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. **Find Largest Prime**: Among the prime numbers found, we need to identify the largest one.
3. **Sum Digits**: Finally, we calculate the sum of the digits of this largest prime number.

Let's implement this in code:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.

    Examples:
    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10
    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25
    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13
    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11
    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3
    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7
    """
    primes = [num for num in lst if is_prime(num)]
    if not primes:
        return 0
    largest_prime = max(primes)
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(largest_prime))
```

**Explanation:**
- The helper function `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
- In the main function `skjkasdkd(lst)`, we first filter the list to get all prime numbers.
- If there are no primes, we return 0 (though the examples always have at least one prime).
- We then find the largest prime from the filtered list.
- Finally, we convert the largest prime to a string to iterate over each digit, convert each digit back to an integer, and sum them up.

This approach efficiently handles the requirements and works for all provided examples.
