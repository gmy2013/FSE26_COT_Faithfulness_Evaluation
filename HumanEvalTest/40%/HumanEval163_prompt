def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are given two positive integers a and b.
 We need to return the even digits between a and b in ascending order.
 Note: The function should work regardless of which of a or b is larger.
 Steps:
 1. Determine the start and end of the range. Since we need ascending order, we should set the start as min(a,b) and end as max(a,b).
 2. We are to collect even digits. Note: The problem says "even digits", meaning the numbers themselves that are even, not the digits within the numbers.
 3. Iterate through the range from min(a,b) to max(a,b)+1 (to include the upper bound).
 4. For each number in the range, check if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2).
 5. Collect all such numbers in a list and return it.

 However, note the example: generate_integers(10,14) returns [].
 Why? Because the numbers between 10 and 14 are 10,11,12,13,14. But the problem says "even digits". Wait, let's read the docstring again: "return the even digits between a and b". This might be ambiguous.

 But looking at the examples:
   generate_integers(2,8) returns [2,4,6,8] -> these are even numbers.
   generate_integers(10,14) returns [] -> but 10,12,14 are even. So why empty?

 Actually, the problem says "even digits", not "even numbers". So we need to interpret it as digits.

 Let's re-read the docstring: "return the even digits between a and b". This might mean that we are to consider each digit in the numbers between a and b, and then pick the even digits (0,2,4,6,8) and return them in ascending order.

 But the example generate_integers(10,14) returns []. Why? Because the numbers between 10 and 14 are 10,11,12,13,14. The digits are: 1,0,1,1,1,2,1,3,1,4. The even digits are 0,2,4. But the example returns [].

 Alternatively, the problem might be intended to return the even numbers that are single-digit? But the example includes 8 which is single-digit, but 10 is two-digit and not included.

 Another interpretation: perhaps "digits" here is a misnomer, and it actually means "numbers". But the example generate_integers(10,14) returns [] which contradicts that because 10,12,14 are even numbers.

 Wait, the example says generate_integers(10,14) returns []. So it is not returning the even numbers. So it must be about digits.

 But then why would generate_integers
