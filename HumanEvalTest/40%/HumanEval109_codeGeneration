CodeGeneration:
Looking at the problem and the chain of thought, I need to implement a function that checks if an array can be sorted by performing right shift operations. The key insight is that in a sorted rotated array with unique elements, there should be exactly one "drop" where an element is greater than the next one (considering the array circularly).

Here's the implementation:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations.
                
    """
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return True
    
    # Count the number of "drops" where arr[i] > arr[i+1] (considering circular array)
    drops = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:
            drops += 1
    
    # If there are no drops, the array is already sorted
    # If there is exactly one drop, we can rotate to make it sorted
    # More than one drop means it cannot be sorted by rotation
    return drops <= 1
```

Let me test this with the provided examples:

1. `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`:
   - 3 < 4 ✓
   - 4 < 5 ✓  
   - 5 > 1 ✗ (drop count = 1)
   - 1 < 2 ✓
   - 2 < 3 ✓ (circular check)
   - Total drops = 1 → returns True ✓

2. `[3, 5, 4, 1, 2]`:
   - 3 < 5 ✓
   - 5 > 4 ✗ (drop count = 1)
   - 4 > 1 ✗ (drop count = 2)
   - 1 < 2 ✓
   - 2 < 3 ✓
   - Total drops = 2 → returns False ✓

The implementation correctly handles both cases by counting the number of "drops" in the circular array and returning True only if there's at most one drop.
