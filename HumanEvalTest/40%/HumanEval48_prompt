The following is chain of thought:
We are checking if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
 Steps:
 1. Normalize the string by converting to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters? 
    But looking at the examples, the function should work with the given strings as-is.
    The examples don't require normalization (all lowercase, no spaces/punctuation).
    So we can proceed without normalization for these test cases.

 2. Compare
