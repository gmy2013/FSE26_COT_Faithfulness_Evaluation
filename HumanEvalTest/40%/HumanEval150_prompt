The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number `n` is prime. If it is prime, we return `x`; otherwise, we return `y`.

1. **Check for prime number**:
   - A prime number is greater than 1 and has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - For numbers less than 2, return `y` (not prime).
   - Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of `n` (effi
