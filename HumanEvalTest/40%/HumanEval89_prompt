    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To implement the `encrypt` function, we need to rotate each letter in the input string by 4 positions (since "two multiplied by two" is 4) in the alphabet. We'll handle both lowercase and uppercase letters, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

Steps:
1. Initialize an empty string for the result.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string.
3. For each alphabetic character:
   - Determine if it's uppercase
