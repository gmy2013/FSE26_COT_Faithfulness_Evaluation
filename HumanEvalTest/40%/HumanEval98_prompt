    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """

The following is chain of thought:
We are counting uppercase vowels that occur at even indices (0-indexed).
 Steps:
 1. Define what are the uppercase vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'
 2. Iterate over the string with index and character.
 3. Check if the index is even (index % 2 == 0) and if the character is an uppercase vowel.
 4. If both conditions are true
