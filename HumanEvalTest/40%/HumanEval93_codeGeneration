CodeGeneration:
Here's the implementation based on the requirements:

```python
def encode(message):
    """
    Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
    """
    result = []
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    
    for char in message:
        # Swap case first
        swapped_char = char.swapcase()
        
        # Check if it's a vowel (after case swap)
        if swapped_char in vowels:
            # Get the ASCII value and add 2
            if swapped_char.islower():
                # For lowercase vowels, wrap around from 'y' to 'a'
                new_char = chr((ord(swapped_char) - ord('a') + 2) % 26 + ord('a'))
            else:
                # For uppercase vowels, wrap around from 'Y' to 'A'
                new_char = chr((ord(swapped_char) - ord('A') + 2) % 26 + ord('A'))
            result.append(new_char)
        else:
            result.append(swapped_char)
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

The function works as follows:
1. First, it swaps the case of each character
2. Then it checks if the character (after case swap) is a vowel
3. If it's a vowel, it calculates the letter two positions ahead, handling wrap-around (e.g., 'y' becomes 'a')
4. If it's not a vowel, it keeps the case-swapped character
5. Finally, it joins all characters into the encoded string

The solution handles both uppercase and lowercase vowels correctly and ensures proper wrap-around for letters at the end of the alphabet.
