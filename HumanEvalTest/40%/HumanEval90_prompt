The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to find the second smallest element in a list of integers. If there is no second smallest element (e.g., the list has fewer than 2 distinct elements), we should return None.

Approach:
1. If the list has less than 2 elements, return None.
2. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates, then back to a sorted list to get unique elements in ascending order.
3. If the sorted unique list has at least 2
