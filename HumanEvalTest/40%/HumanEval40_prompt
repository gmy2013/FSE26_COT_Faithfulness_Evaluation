The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there are three distinct elements in a list of integers that sum to zero. The solution should efficiently check all possible triplets without duplicates.

Approach:
1. Sort the list to facilitate the two-pointer technique for the inner loop.
2. Iterate through each element as the first element of the triplet.
3. For each first element, use two pointers (left and right) to find two other elements such that the sum of the triplet
