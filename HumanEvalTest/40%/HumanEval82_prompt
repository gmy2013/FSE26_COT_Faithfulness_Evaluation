The following is chain of thought:
We are given a string and need to check if its length is a prime number.
 Steps:
 1. Calculate the length of the string.
 2. If the length is less than 2, it is not prime (since 0 and 1 are not primes).
 3. For numbers >= 2, check for factors from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive).
    If any number divides it, then it is not prime.
 4. Return True if prime, else False.

 However, note the examples:
   'Hello' has length 5 -> prime -> True.
   'abcdcba' has length 7 -> prime -> True.
