CodeGeneration:
keep track of the balance between open and close parentheses.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - Loop through each character in the `paren_string`.

3. **Process Each Character**:
   - Ignore any spaces in the string.
   - If the character is an open parenthesis `(`:
     - Append it to `current_group`.
     - Increment the `balance` counter by 1.
   - If the character is a close parenthesis `)`:
     - Append it to `current_group`.
     - Decrement the `balance` counter by 1.

4. **Check for Complete Groups**:
   - Whenever the `balance` counter reaches 0, it indicates that a complete balanced group of parentheses has been formed.
   - At this point, append `current_group` to the `result` list.
   - Reset `current_group` to an empty string to start accumulating the next group.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all characters, return the `result` list containing all separate groups of balanced parentheses.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current_group = ""
    balance = 0
    
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        current_group += char
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance == 0 and current_group:
            result.append(current_group)
            current_group = ""
    
    return result
```

This function will correctly separate groups of balanced parentheses while ignoring spaces, as described in the docstring.
