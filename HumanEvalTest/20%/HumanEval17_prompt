    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we'll start by analyzing the input string and breaking it down into recognizable patterns that correspond to the musical notes. Here's a structured plan to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Input Format**: The input string consists of musical notes separated by spaces. Each note is rep
