The following is chain of thought:
To determine the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Handle the smallest prime factor (2):**
   - First, check if `n` is divisible by 2. 
   - While `n` is even (i.e., divisible by 2), divide `n` by 2.
   - This ensures that we remove
