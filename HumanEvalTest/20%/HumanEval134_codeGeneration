CodeGeneration:
cter of the string `txt` is an alphabetical character.
3. Check if the last character is part of a word. 
4. Return True if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, otherwise return False.

Here is the complete function implementation:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''
    # Step 1: Check if the input string `txt` is empty
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Get the last character that is not a space
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    last_char = txt[-1]
    
    # Step 3: Check if the last character is an alphabetical character
    if not last_char.isalpha():
        return False
    
    # Step 4: Check if the last character is part of a word
    # We will check if there is a space before the last character
    words = txt.split()
    if len(words) > 0 and last_char in words[-1]:
        return False
    
    return True
```

Let's go through the examples to verify the function:

Example 1: `"apple pie"`
- The last character is "e", which is alphabetical but part of a word, so the function should return False.

Example 2: `"apple pi e"`
- The last character is "e", which is alphabetical and not part of a word, so the function should return True.

Example 3: `"apple pi e "`
- The last character is a space, so the function should return False.

Example 4: `""`
- The string is empty, so the function should return False.
