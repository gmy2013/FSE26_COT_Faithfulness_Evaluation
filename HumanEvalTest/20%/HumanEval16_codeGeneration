CodeGeneration:
'X', 'x', and 'X' are considered the same character.
2. Plan the solution:
   - Convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.
   - Use a set to store characters since a set automatically handles duplicates and only keeps unique elements.
   - Add each character from the string to the set.
   - The number of distinct characters is simply the size of the set.
3. Implement the solution:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase
    lowercase_string = string.lower()
    
    # Create a set to store unique characters
    unique_characters = set(lowercase_string)
    
    # Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters
    return len(unique_characters)
```

This implementation will correctly return the number of distinct characters in the input string, considering case insensitivity.
