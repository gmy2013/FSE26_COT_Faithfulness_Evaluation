CodeGeneration:
cases**: We begin by handling the base cases explicitly. According to the definition:
   - `fibfib(0) = 0`
   - `fibfib(1) = 0`
   - `fibfib(2) = 1`

2. **Iterative Computation**: For `n >= 3`, we use an iterative approach to compute each `fibfib(i)` up to `fibfib(n)`. We need to keep track of the last three computed values to efficiently calculate the next value in the sequence.

3. **Optimization with Constant Space**: Instead of keeping an array of all computed values, we can maintain just three variables to store the last three values of the sequence, updating them iteratively as we progress.

Here's how the implementation would look:

```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    """The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
    >>> fibfib(1)
    0
    >>> fibfib(5)
    4
    >>> fibfib(8)
    24
    """
    
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Variables to store the last three values
    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1  # Corresponds to fibfib(0), fibfib(1), fibfib(2)
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # Compute the next value in the sequence
        current = a + b + c
        # Update the last three values
        a, b, c = b, c, current
    
    # The result is stored in `c` since `c` is the most recent computed fibfib(i)
    return c
```

This implementation efficiently computes the n-th FibFib number using O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
