CodeGeneration:
To handle the rotation correctly, we'll shift each character by 4 positions in the alphabet. We need to ensure that the rotation wraps around if it goes beyond 'z'. Here's the implementation:

```python
def encrypt(s):
    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            # Calculate the base: 'a' for lowercase, 'A' for uppercase
            base = ord('a') if char.islower() else ord('A')
            # Rotate the character by 4 positions (2 * 2 = 4)
            rotated_char = chr((ord(char) - base + 4) % 26 + base)
            result.append(rotated_char)
        else:
            # Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)
```

This function handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, rotating each by 4 positions in the alphabet while preserving case. Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged. The rotation wraps around using modulo 26 to handle letters at the end of the alphabet.
