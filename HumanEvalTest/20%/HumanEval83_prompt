The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to count the n-digit positive integers that either start with 1 or end with 1 (or both). We can break this down using the principle of inclusion-exclusion to avoid double-counting numbers that both start and end with 1.

1. **Total n-digit numbers that start with 1**: The first digit must be 1 (1 option), and the remaining n-1 digits can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 options each). However, note that the entire number is n-digit, so the first digit cannot be 0. But since we are fixing the first digit to 1, we don't have to worry about 0. So, count_start = 1 * (10 ** (n-1))

2. **Total n-digit n
