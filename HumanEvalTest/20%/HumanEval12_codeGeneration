```python
     found so far. These will be `max_length` to store the length of the longest string found, and `longest_string` to store the string itself. Both can start with initial values of `0` and `None`, respectively.

3. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - Loop through each string in the `strings` list.

4. **Compare String Lengths**:
   - For each string, check its length. If it is greater than `max_length`, update `max_length` and `longest_string` with the current string's length and the string itself.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After finishing the loop, `longest_string` will hold the longest string from the list. Return `longest_string`.

Here's the completed function:

```python
def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """ Out of list of strings, return the longest one. Return the first one in case of multiple
    strings of the same length. Return None in case the input list is empty.
    """
    if not strings:  # Check for empty list
        return None

    max_length = 0
    longest_string = None

    for string in strings:
        if len(string) > max_length:
            max_length = len(string)
            longest_string = string

    return longest_string
```
```
