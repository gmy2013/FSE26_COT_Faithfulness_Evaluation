The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the Problem**: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The task is to return the n-th Fibonacci number using a zero-based index where fib(0) = 0.

2. **Recogn
