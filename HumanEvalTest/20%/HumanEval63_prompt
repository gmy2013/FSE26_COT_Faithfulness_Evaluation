    """The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:
    fibfib(0) == 0
    fibfib(1) == 0
    fibfib(2) == 1
    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).
    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.
    >>> fibfib(1)

    >>> fibfib(5)

    >>> fibfib(8)

The following is chain of thought:
To efficiently compute the n-th element of the FibFib sequence, we need to avoid the exponential time complexity that comes with a naive recursive approach. Instead, we can use an iterative approach with dynamic programming concepts to store the results of previous computations.
