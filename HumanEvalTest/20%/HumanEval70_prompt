    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]

The following is chain of thought:
To solve the problem of sorting a list in the "strange" order as described, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize** an empty list called `result` to store the final ordered elements.
2. **Sor
