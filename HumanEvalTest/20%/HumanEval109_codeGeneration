Here's the implementation:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    if not arr:
        return True
        
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the number of positions where current > next (drops)
    drops = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:
            drops += 1
            if drops > 1:
                return False
    
    return drops <= 1
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty array check**: If the array is empty, return True as specified.

2. **Count drops**: We iterate through the array and count how many times an element is greater than the next element (considering the circular nature using modulo). In a properly rotated sorted array, there should be at most 1 such "drop" - this occurs at the wrap-around point where the largest element meets the smallest element.

3. **Decision logic**: 
   - If there are 0 drops, the array is already sorted
   - If there is exactly 1 drop, we can rotate the array to make it sorted
   - If there are more than 1 drops, no rotation can make the array sorted

This approach efficiently checks the condition in O(n) time with O(1) space complexity.
