the list to determine whether it has an odd or even number of elements.

3. **Find the Median**:
   - If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. This can be found using integer division by 2 on the length to index into the sorted list.
   - If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements. These can be found by taking the elements at positions `(length // 2) - 1` and `length // 2` in the sorted list.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def median(l: list) -> float:
    """Return median of elements in the list l."""
    # Step 1: Sort the list
    sorted_list = sorted(l)
    
    # Step 2: Determine the length of the list
    n = len(sorted_list)
    
    # Step 3: Find the median
    if n % 2 == 1:
        # Odd number of elements, return the middle one
        return sorted_list[n // 2]
    else:
        # Even number of elements, return the average of the two middle ones
        mid1 = sorted_list[n // 2 - 1]
        mid2 = sorted_list[n // 2]
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2
