    """
    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,
    and return it in lowercase.
    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000

    Examples:
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to convert a given positive integer (between 1 and 1000) into its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase. The approach involves mapping the integer to its corresponding Roman numeral string by breaking down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units places, and then converting each part using predefined mappings.
