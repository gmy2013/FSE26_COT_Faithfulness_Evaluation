This implementation uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers less than `n`. The algorithm works by:

1. Creating a boolean list `sieve` where each index represents a number
2. Marking 0 and 1 as non-prime (False)
3. Iterating through numbers starting from 2
4. When finding a prime number, adding it to the result list and marking all its multiples as non-prime
5. Returning the list of primes found

The time complexity is O(n log log n) and space complexity is O(n), making it efficient for finding primes up to moderately large values of `n`.
