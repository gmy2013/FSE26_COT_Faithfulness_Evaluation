The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to approach it in the following structured manner:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - The function should check if the given number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.
   - The number `a` is less than 100.

2. **Generate the List of Pri
