CodeGeneration:
To implement the `count_up_to(n)` function, we need to generate all prime numbers less than `n`. Since `n` is non-negative, we handle cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning an empty list. For larger `n`, we iterate through numbers from 2 to `n-1`, check if each is prime, and collect the primes.

We'll create a helper function `is_prime(x)` to check if a number is prime, then use it to filter numbers less than `n`.

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    """
    if n <= 2:
        return []
    
    def is_prime(x):
        if x < 2:
            return False
        if x == 2:
            return True
        if x % 2 == 0:
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(x**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
    
    return primes
```
