1. **Understanding the Polynomial Evaluation**:
   - You need a function to evaluate the polynomial at a given point `x`. You've already provided a `poly(xs, x)` function that does this. It evaluates the polynomial with coefficients `xs` at the point `x`.

2. **Derivative of the Polynomial**:
   - To apply the Newton-Raphson method, you also need the derivative of the polynomial. You should write a function to compute the derivative of the polynomial at a given point.

3. **Newton-Raphson Iteration**:
   - The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative technique where, starting from an initial guess `x0`, you update the guess using the formula:
     \[
     x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
     \]
     Here, `f(x)` is the polynomial evaluated at `x`, and `f'(x)` is the derivative evaluated at `x`.

4. **Initial Guess and Convergence**:
   - Choose a reasonable initial guess for `x`. You might start with `x0 = 0` unless you have a better idea based on the problem.
   - Implement a loop that performs the iteration and checks for convergence, i.e., when the change in `x` becomes very small or when `f(x)` becomes very close to zero.

5. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - Ensure that you handle the case when the derivative is zero to prevent division by zero in the Newton-Raphson update formula.
   - You only need to find one root, even if the polynomial has multiple roots.

Here is the completed implementation of `find_zero` using these thoughts:

```python
def poly_derivative(xs: list, x: float):
    """Calculates the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs at point x."""
    return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """Finds one zero of the polynomial with coefficients xs using the Newton-Raphson method."""
    # Initial guess
    x0 = 0.0
    tolerance = 1e-7
    max_iterations = 1000
    
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        fx = poly(xs, x0)
        f_prime_x = poly_derivative(xs, x0)
        
        # If the derivative is zero, we can't proceed with this method
        if f_prime_x == 0:
            raise ValueError("Derivative is zero; Newton-Raphson method fails.")
        
        # Newton-Raphson step
        x1 = x0 - fx / f_prime_x
        
        # Check for convergence
        if abs(x1 - x0) < tolerance:
            return x1
        
        x0 = x1
    
    # If we reach here, we did not converge
    raise ValueError("Failed to find a root within the maximum number of iterations.")
```

This implementation attempts to find a root of the polynomial using the Newton-Raphson method. The `poly_derivative` function computes the derivative of the polynomial, which is necessary for the method. The function iteratively updates the guess until it converges or it hits the maximum number of iterations.
