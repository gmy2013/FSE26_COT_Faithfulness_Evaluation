Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''
    total = 0
    for num in lst:
        # Check if number is positive, integer, and odd
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 == 1:
            total += num * num
    return total
```

This implementation:
1. Iterates through each number in the list
2. Checks if the number is a positive integer and odd (using `num % 2 == 1`)
3. Adds the square of qualifying numbers to the total
4. Returns 0 for empty lists automatically since the loop won't execute
5. Handles all the test cases correctly by ignoring negative numbers and non-integers
