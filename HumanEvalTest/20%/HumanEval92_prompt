    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False

The following is chain of thought:
We are given three numbers x, y, z.
 We need to check:
  1. All numbers are integers.
  2. One of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.

 Steps:
  - First, check if all three are integers. If any
