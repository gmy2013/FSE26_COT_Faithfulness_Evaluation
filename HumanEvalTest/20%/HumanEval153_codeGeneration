count of lowercase letters).
2. We'll iterate through each extension in the list and calculate its strength.
3. We need to keep track of the strongest extension found so far, and if multiple have the same strength, choose the first one.
4. Finally, return the result in the format "ClassName.StrongestExtensionName".

Here is the implementation:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    strongest_extension = None
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    
    for ext in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for char in ext if char.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for char in ext if char.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = ext
    
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"
```

Let me test it with the provided example:
- For 'SErviNGSliCes': CAP = 6 (S,E,N,G,S,C), SM = 7 (r,v,i,i,l,i,e) → strength = 6-7 = -1
- For 'Cheese': CAP = 1 (C), SM = 5 (h,e,e,s,e) → strength = 1-5 = -4
- For 'StuFfed': CAP = 2 (S,F), SM = 5 (t,u,e,d) → strength = 2-5 = -3

So 'SErviNGSliCes' with strength -1 is indeed the strongest.
