def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

The following is chain of thought:
To determine if a triangle is right-angled, we need to check if the square of the longest side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (Pythagorean theorem). Steps:
1. Identify the lo
