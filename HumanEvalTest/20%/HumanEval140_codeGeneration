CodeGeneration:
Sure, let's complete the function following the given chain of thought:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters of the given text.
2. Loop through each character in the text.
3. Check if the character is a space.
4. If it's a space, check how many consecutive spaces are there.
5. Replace one space with an underscore and consecutive spaces with a dash.
6. Append the modified characters to the list.
7. Join the list into a single string and return it.

Here is the completed function:

```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    """
    Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores,
    and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces,
    then replace all consecutive spaces with -

    fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"
    fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"
    fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"
    fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters
    modified_text = []
    
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of consecutive spaces
    space_count = 0
    
    for char in text:
        if char == ' ':
            space_count += 1
        else:
            if space_count == 1:
                modified_text.append('_')
            elif space_count > 1:
                modified_text.append('-')
            space_count = 0
            modified_text.append(char)
    
    # If the string ends with spaces, we need to handle that too
    if space_count == 1:
        modified_text.append('_')
    elif space_count > 1:
        modified_text.append('-')
    
    # Join list into a single string and return it
    return ''.join(modified_text)
