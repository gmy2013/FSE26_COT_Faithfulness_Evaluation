2. **Identify Key Points**:
   - The problem states that each set has `n` cars.
   - Each car from the left-moving set will collide with each car from the right-moving set at some point as they are moving towards each other directly on a straight line.
   - Since cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving unaffected, the problem is solely about counting these collisions.

3. **Count Collisions**:
   - Each car from the left-moving set will collide exactly once with each car from the right-moving set.
   - Therefore, if there are `n` cars in each set, each car from one set will collide with all `n` cars from the opposite set.
   - This results in a total of `n * n` collisions.

4. **Implement the Function**:
   - Since we have determined that the number of collisions will always be `n * n`, the function can be implemented to directly return this value.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """
    return n * n
```

This implementation correctly calculates the number of collisions based on the observations and logic derived from the problem setup.
