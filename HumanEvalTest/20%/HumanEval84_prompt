    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of the digits of a given positive integer N, and then return that sum in binary representation as a string. The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the sum of digits of N**: Convert N to a string t
