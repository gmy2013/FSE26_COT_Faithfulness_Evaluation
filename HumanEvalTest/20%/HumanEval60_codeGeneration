   The sequence of numbers we need to sum is an arithmetic sequence starting from 1 and ending at n, with a common difference of 1.

2. **Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**
   The formula to find the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the last number in the sequence.

3. **Implement the formula in the function:**
   We'll use this formula in our function to calculate the sum quickly and efficiently without needing to iterate through all numbers.

Here's the implementation of the function using the above steps:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    # Apply the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This function uses integer division (`//`) to ensure the result is an integer, which is appropriate since the sum of natural numbers should indeed be an integer.
