sure, I can complete the function based on your docstring and chain of thought.

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    """
    Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which
    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If
    no such element exists then return -1. The given array will not contain
    duplicate values.

    Examples:
    can_arrange([1,2,4,3,5]) = 3
    can_arrange([1,2,3]) = -1
    """
    # Initialize the variable to store the largest index
    max_index = -1
    
    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element (index 1)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is less than the previous element
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            # Update max_index to the current index
            max_index = i
            
    return max_index
