To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic, we can use the following structured approach:

1. **Identify Pairs in the Array:**
   - For a given element at index `i`, its counterpart in a palindromic array is at index `n - 1 - i`, where `n` is the length of the array.
   - We will iterate through the array from the start to the middle, comparing each element to its counterpart and counting how many of them differ.

2. **Count Differences:**
   - For each pair `(arr[i], arr[n - 1 - i])`, check if they are different. If they are different, it means a change is needed to make them the same.
   - Count the number of such pairs that need to be changed.

3. **Return the Count:**
   - The count of differing pairs represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    """
    n = len(arr)
    changes_needed = 0
    
    # Iterate over the first half of the array
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr[n - 1 - i]:
            changes_needed += 1
            
    return changes_needed
```

This function iterates over half of the array, compares each element with its counterpart from the other end, and counts the number of mismatches. This count gives the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.
