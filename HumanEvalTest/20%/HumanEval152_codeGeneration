CodeGeneration:
0 if the guess is correct (i.e., game[i] == guess[i])
  Otherwise, the absolute difference between the actual score and the guessed score (abs(game[i] - guess[i]))

We can iterate through both lists simultaneously and compute the result for each index.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def compare(game,guess):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(game)):
        if game[i] == guess[i]:
            result.append(0)
        else:
            result.append(abs(game[i] - guess[i]))
    return result
```

Alternatively, we can use a list comprehension for a more concise solution:

```python
def compare(game,guess):
    return [0 if g == h else abs(g - h) for g, h in zip(game, guess)]
```

Both implementations will produce the correct results for the given examples.
