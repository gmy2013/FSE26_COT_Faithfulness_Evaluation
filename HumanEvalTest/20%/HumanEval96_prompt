def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To implement the `count_up_to(n)` function, we need to generate all prime numbers less than `n`. Since `n` is non-negative, we handle cases where `n` is 0 or 1 by returning an empty list. For larger `n`, we iterate through numbers from 2 to `n-1`, check if each is prime, and collect the primes.

We'll create a helper function
