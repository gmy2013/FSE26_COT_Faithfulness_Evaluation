string `brackets`.

3. For each character, if it is an opening bracket '(', increment the counter by one.

4. If it is a closing bracket ')', decrement the counter by one.

5. If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones up to that point, so return False immediately.

6. After processing all characters, check if the counter is zero. If it is, it means all opening brackets have been closed properly, so return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
    counter = 0
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            counter += 1
        elif char == ')':
            counter -= 1
        
        # If counter is negative, there are more closing brackets than opening ones
        if counter < 0:
            return False
    
    # Check if all opening brackets are closed
    return counter == 0
```
