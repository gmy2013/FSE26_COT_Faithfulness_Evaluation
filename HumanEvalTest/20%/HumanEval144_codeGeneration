iply the fractions:** The product of two fractions (a/b) * (c/d) is (a*c) / (b*d). We compute the numerator and denominator of the product.
4. **Check if the product is a whole number:** A fraction is a whole number if the denominator divides the numerator exactly, i.e., (numerator % denominator) == 0. However, note that after multiplication, we have a fraction in the form (a*c)/(b*d). So we need to check if (a*c) is divisible by (b*d).
5. **Return True if divisible, False otherwise.**

Let's implement the function accordingly.

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    # Parse the first fraction x: split into numerator and denominator
    num_x, denom_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    # Parse the second fraction n: split into numerator and denominator
    num_n, denom_n = map(int, n.split('/'))
    
    # Multiply the fractions: numerator = num_x * num_n, denominator = denom_x * denom_n
    numerator = num_x * num_n
    denominator = denom_x * denom_n
    
    # Check if numerator is divisible by denominator
    if numerator % denominator == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function correctly checks whether the product of the two fractions is a whole number by verifying if the numerator is divisible by the denominator after multiplication.
