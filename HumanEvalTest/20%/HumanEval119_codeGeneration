To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can concatenate the two given strings in either order to form a balanced parentheses string. A string of parentheses is considered balanced if for every opening parenthesis '(', there is a corresponding closing parenthesis ')', and they are properly nested.

Here's the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:

1. **Check Each Order:** We need to check both possible concatenations of the two strings: `lst[0] + lst[1]` and `lst[1] + lst[0]`.

2. **Validation Function:** We will create a helper function to validate if a given string of parentheses is balanced.

3. **Return Result:** If either concatenation results in a balanced string, we return 'Yes'. Otherwise, we return 'No'.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def is_balanced(s):
    """
    Helper function to check if the string s is a balanced parentheses string.
    """
    balance = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    return balance == 0

def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''
    # Concatenate the strings in both possible orders
    concat1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    concat2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    
    # Check if either concatenated string is balanced
    if is_balanced(concat1) or is_balanced(concat2):
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
