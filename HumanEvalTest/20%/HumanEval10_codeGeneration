Identify the Longest Palindromic Suffix**: To achieve this, we need to find the longest suffix of the string that is already a palindrome. This helps us minimize the number of characters we need to add to the beginning of the string to make the entire string a palindrome.

3. **Construct the Shortest Palindrome**: Once the longest palindromic suffix is identified, the characters before this suffix are the ones that need to be mirrored or reversed and appended to the beginning of the string to form a palindrome.

Let's implement this logic in the `make_palindrome` function:

```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    
    def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
        return s == s[::-1]

    # Edge case: If the string is already a palindrome, return it as is
    if is_palindrome(string):
        return string

    # Find the longest palindromic suffix
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            # Once the longest palindromic suffix is found, break
            break

    # All characters before the palindromic suffix
    prefix_to_add = string[:i][::-1]

    # Return the modified string with the necessary prefix added
    return string + prefix_to_add
