CodeGeneration:
list is empty or has only one distinct value), we should return None.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of integers.
    Write a function next_smallest() that returns the 2nd smallest element of the list.
    Return None if there is no such element.
    
    next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2
    next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]) == 2
    next_smallest([]) == None
    next_smallest([1, 1]) == None
    """
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Remove duplicates and sort to get unique elements in ascending order
    unique_sorted = sorted(set(lst))
    
    # If there are at least 2 distinct elements, return the second one
    if len(unique_sorted) >= 2:
        return unique_sorted[1]
    else:
        return None
```

This implementation:
1. First checks if the list has fewer than 2 elements (immediate None return)
2. Converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, then sorts it
3. If there are at least 2 distinct elements, returns the second smallest
4. Returns None if there's only one distinct element (like [1, 1])
