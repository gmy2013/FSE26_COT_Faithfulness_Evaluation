Sure! Let's complete the function based on the provided docstring and the chain of thought.

First, we will verify that the input integer `n` is greater than 0. If it's not, we can raise an exception or handle the error as required.

Next, we initialize a variable to hold the result of the special factorial. We will then iterate from `n` down to 1, calculating the factorial for each number and multiplying it into our result.

Here's the complete code for the function:

```python
import math

def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Verify that input integer n is greater than 0.
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("The input integer must be greater than 0.")
    
    # Step 2: Initialize a variable to hold the result.
    result = 1
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the special factorial.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= math.factorial(i)
    
    return result
