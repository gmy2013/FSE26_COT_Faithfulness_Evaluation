CodeGeneration:
To complete the function `odd_count`, we'll follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the results.
2. Iterate over each string in the input list.
3. For each string, count the number of odd digits.
4. Construct the output string based on the count of odd digits.
5. Append the constructed string to the results list.
6. Return the results list.

Here's the complete code:

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

    >>> odd_count(['1234567'])
    ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
    >>> odd_count(['3',"11111111"])
    ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.",
     "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]
    """
    results = []
    for s in lst:
        odd_count = sum(1 for char in s if char in '13579')
        output = f"the number of odd elements {odd_count}n the str{odd_count}ng {odd_count} of the {odd_count}nput."
        results.append(output)
    return results
```

Explanation:

- We use a generator expression within the `sum()` function to count the number of odd digits in each string.
- We construct the output string using an f-string, replacing the specified characters with the count of odd digits.
- Finally, we append each constructed string to the results list and return it.
