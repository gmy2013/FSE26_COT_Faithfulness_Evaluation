    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return
    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs
    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.
    Note: return None for empty arr.

    Example:
    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9
    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0

The following is chain of thought:
1. Check if the input array `arr` is empty. If it is, return `None`.
2. Initialize a variable `product_of_signs` to 1, which will hold the product of the
