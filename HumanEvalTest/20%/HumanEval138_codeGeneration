To determine if a given number \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, we need to consider the characteristics of even numbers and their sums. Here are some key observations:

1. Any even number can be written as \( 2k \), where \( k \) is an integer.
2. The smallest set of four positive even numbers is \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \).
3. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 8 to be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.
4. If \( n \geq 8 \) and is even, it can always be decomposed into four positive even numbers.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
    Example:
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    # Check if n is at least 8 and is even
    if n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
