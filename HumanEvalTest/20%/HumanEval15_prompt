The following is chain of thought:
To solve the problem, the function `string_sequence` needs to generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `n`, inclusive, and return those numbers as a space-delimited string. Here's a structured chain of thought to implement this:

1. **Understand the input and output requirements**:
   - Input: An integer `n`.
   - Outp
