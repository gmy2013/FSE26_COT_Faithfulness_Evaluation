To find the derivative of the polynomial represented by the list `xs`, we can apply the following steps:

1. **Ignore the Constant Term:** The derivative of a constant term is zero, so we can start computing derivatives from the linear term `xs[1] * x`.

2. **Apply Power Rule:** For a term `xs[i] * x^i`, the derivative is `i * xs[i] * x^(i-1)`. This means:
   - The coefficient for the term `x^(i-1)` after differentiation is `i * xs[i]`.

3. **Generate the Result List:** We'll iterate over `xs` starting from index 1, apply the above derivative rule, and collect the results into a new list.

Let's implement this logic in the function:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
    Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    """
    # Initialize an empty list for the derivative coefficients
    derivative_coeffs = []
    
    # Iterate over the list starting from index 1
    for i in range(1, len(xs)):
        # Apply the power rule: i * xs[i]
        derivative_coeffs.append(i * xs[i])
    
    return derivative_coeffs
