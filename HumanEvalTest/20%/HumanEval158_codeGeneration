Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def find_max(words):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.

    find_max(["name", "of", "string"]) == "string"
    find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]) == "enam"
    find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb" ,"cc"]) == "aaaaaaa"
    """
    if not words:
        return ""
    
    max_unique = -1
    candidates = []
    
    for word in words:
        unique_count = len(set(word))
        
        if unique_count > max_unique:
            max_unique = unique_count
            candidates = [word]
        elif unique_count == max_unique:
            candidates.append(word)
    
    # Return the lexicographically first word among candidates
    return min(candidates) if candidates else ""
```

The function works as follows:
1. First checks if the input list is empty and returns an empty string if so
2. Iterates through each word, calculating the number of unique characters using `len(set(word))`
3. Maintains a list of candidate words that have the current maximum unique character count
4. When a word with more unique characters is found, it updates the maximum and resets the candidate list
5. When words have the same number of unique characters, they're added to the candidate list
6. Finally returns the lexicographically first word from the candidate list using `min()`

The examples provided in the docstring will work correctly with this implementation.
