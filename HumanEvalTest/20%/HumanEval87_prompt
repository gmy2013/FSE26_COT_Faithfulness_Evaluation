    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]

    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]

The following is chain of thought:
We are given a nested list `lst` and an integer `x`.
 We need to find all occurrences of `x` and return their coordinates as (row, column).
 The result should be sorted first by row in ascending order, and for the same row, by column in descending order.

 Steps:
 1. Initialize an empty list for the result.
 2. Iterate over each row (with index i) in the given list `lst`.
 3. For each row, iterate over e
