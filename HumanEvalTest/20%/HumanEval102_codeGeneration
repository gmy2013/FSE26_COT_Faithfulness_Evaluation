```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.

    For example:
    choose_num(12, 15) = 14
    choose_num(13, 12) = -1
    """
    # If x is greater than y, return -1 as there is no valid range
    if x > y:
        return -1

    # Iterate from y down to x to find the largest even number in the range
    for num in range(y, x - 1, -1):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num
    
    # If no even number is found, return -1
    return -1
```

This function first checks if `x` is greater than `y` and returns -1 if it is, as the range would be invalid. It then iterates from `y` down to `x` to find the largest even number in the range, returning it as soon as one is found. If no even number is found within the range, the function returns -1.
