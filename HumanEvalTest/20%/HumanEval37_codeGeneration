To solve this problem, we need to extract the elements at even indices from the list `l`, sort those elements, and then place them back into their original positions in a new list that retains the original odd-index elements. Here's how the implementation would look like:

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indices, while its values at the even indices are equal
    to the values of the even indices of l, but sorted.
    """
    # Extract elements at even indices
    even_elements = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    
    # Sort the elements at even indices
    even_elements_sorted = sorted(even_elements)
    
    # Create a new list to hold the result
    result = l[:]
    
    # Replace the even indices in the result with the sorted elements
    even_index = 0
    for i in range(0, len(l), 2):
        result[i] = even_elements_sorted[even_index]
        even_index += 1
    
    return result
