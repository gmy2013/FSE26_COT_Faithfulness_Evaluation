CodeGeneration:
decode the encoded string, we will need to reverse the shift applied during the encoding process. This means shifting each character 5 positions backward in the alphabet. 

Here's how to implement the `decode_shift` function:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
