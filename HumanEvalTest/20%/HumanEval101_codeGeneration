paces.
2. Use the delimiters to split the string into words.
3. Return the resulting list of words.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def words_string(s):
    # Identify the delimiters: commas and spaces
    delimiters = [',', ' ']
    
    # Use the delimiters to split the string into words
    # Replace commas with spaces and then split by spaces
    words = s.replace(',', ' ').split()
    
    # Return the resulting list of words
    return words
```

This function will handle both commas and spaces as delimiters and return an array of words.
