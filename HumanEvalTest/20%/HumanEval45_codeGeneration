base} \times \text{height} \).
   - In this context, `a` represents the length of a side, which we'll interpret as the base of the triangle, and `h` represents the height perpendicular to that base.

2. **Implement the Function**:
   - Multiply the base (`a`) by the height (`h`).
   - Divide the result by 2 to get the area.

3. **Return the Calculated Area**:
   - Return the result as a floating point number to match the expected output.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and height return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    # Calculate the area using the formula: Area = 0.5 * base * height
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```
