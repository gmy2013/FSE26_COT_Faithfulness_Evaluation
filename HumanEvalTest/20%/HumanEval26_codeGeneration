he input list.
   - The order of elements in the output list should be the same as their first appearance in the input list.

3. **Plan the solution**:
   - Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element in the list.
   - Traverse the list and add elements to the result list if they occur exactly once.
   - Ensure the order of elements in the result list is the same as their order in the input list.

4. **Implement the solution**:

```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each element
    count = {}
    for number in numbers:
        if number in count:
            count[number] += 1
        else:
            count[number] = 1
    
    # Step 2: Collect elements that occur exactly once
    result = []
    for number in numbers:
        if count[number] == 1:
            result.append(number)
    
    return result
