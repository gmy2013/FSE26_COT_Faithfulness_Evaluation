CodeGeneration:
ly decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the previous element.

2. **Solution approach:**
   - We will iterate through the list and compare consecutive elements.
   - We need two flags: `increasing` and `decreasing`. 
   - Initialize both flags to `True`.
   - As we iterate, if we find any instance where a number is greater than the previous one, we set `increasing` to `False`.
   - Similarly, if we find any instance where a number is less than the previous one, we set `decreasing` to `False`.
   - After processing all elements, if either `increasing` or `decreasing` remains `True`, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

Now let's write the code for this logic:

```python
def monotonic(l: list) -> bool:
    if len(l) <= 1:
        return True  # A list with zero or one element is trivially monotonic
    
    increasing = True
    decreasing = True
    
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        if l[i] > l[i - 1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif l[i] < l[i - 1]:
            increasing = False
    
    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function checks the monotonicity of the list by iterating through the list and adjusting flags based on comparisons between consecutive elements. The function returns `True` if either flag remains `True`, indicating the list is monotonic in one direction.
