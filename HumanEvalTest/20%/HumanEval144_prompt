    """Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the product of two fractions (given as strings) results in a whole number. The fractions are in the form "numerator/denominator". The approach involves parsing these strings, converting them into numerical fractions, multiplying them, and then checking if the result is an integer.

**Chain of Thought:**
1. **Parse the input strings:** Each input string is a fraction in the form "a/b". We need to split these strings to extract the numerator and denominator for both fractions.
2. **Convert to integers:** Convert the extracted numerator and denominator strings into integers to perform arithmetic operations.
3. **Mult
