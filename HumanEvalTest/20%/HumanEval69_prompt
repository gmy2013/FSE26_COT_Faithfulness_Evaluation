def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1

The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the problem:** We need to find the greatest integer in a list that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If no such integer exists, return -1.

2. **Steps to solve the problem:**

   - **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency dictionary to count how many
