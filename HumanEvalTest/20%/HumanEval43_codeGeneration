CodeGeneration:
y or contains only one element, it's impossible to have two distinct elements, so the function should return `False`.

3. **Approach**:
   - We can solve this problem by using a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. For each element `x` in the list, we check if its negation `-x` has already been seen in the set. 
   - If `-x` is present in the set, it means we have found two distinct elements (`x` and `-x`) that sum to zero, and we return `True`.
   - If we finish checking all elements without finding such a pair, we return `False`.

Here is the implementation of the function:

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    """
    seen = set()
    for number in l:
        if -number in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(number)
    return False
```

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) due to the usage of the set for constant-time lookups and insertions.
