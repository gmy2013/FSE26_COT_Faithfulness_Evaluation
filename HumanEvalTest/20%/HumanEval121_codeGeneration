CodeGeneration:
To complete this function, let's follow these steps:
1. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the odd elements at even positions.
2. Iterate through the list by using the index to check for even positions.
3. Check if the element at the even position is odd.
4. If it is odd, add it to the sum.
5. Return the computed sum.

Here is the code:

```python
def solution(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
    
    Examples
    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12
    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9
    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0
    """
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    result = 0
    
    # Iterate through the list by index
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):
        # Check if the element at even position is odd
        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:
            # Add the odd element to the sum
            result += lst[i]
    
    return result
```

Let's break down the examples given in the docstring to ensure the function works correctly:
1. `solution([5, 8, 7, 1])`:
   - Elements at even positions: 5 (index 0) and 7 (index 2)
   - Both 5 and 7 are odd
   - Sum = 5 + 7 = 12
2. `solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])`:
   - Elements at even positions: 3 (index 0), 3 (index 2), and 3 (index 4)
   - All are odd
   - Sum = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9
3. `solution([30, 13, 24, 321])`:
   - Elements at even positions: 30 (index 0) and 24 (index 2)
   - Both are even
   - Sum = 0

The function should now correctly compute the sum of all odd elements that are at even positions in the list.
