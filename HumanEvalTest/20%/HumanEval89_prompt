    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    """

The following is chain of thought:
To solve this problem, we need to encrypt a string by rotating each letter in the alphabet by a fixed amount. The rotation is defined as shifting each letter down by two multiplied by two places, which is equivalent to shifting by 4 positions (since 2 * 2 = 4). For example, 'a' becomes 'e', 'b' becomes 'f', and so on. We need
