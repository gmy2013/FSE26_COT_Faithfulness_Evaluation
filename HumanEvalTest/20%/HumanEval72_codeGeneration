```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    # Check if q is a palindrome (balanced)
    is_balanced = q == q[::-1]
    
    # Calculate the sum of its elements
    total_weight = sum(q)
    
    # Check if total_weight is less than or equal to w
    is_within_weight = total_weight <= w
    
    # Return True if both conditions are met
    return is_balanced and is_within_weight
```

This function determines whether an object `q` will fly by checking two conditions:

1. **Balanced**: The object `q` is considered balanced if it is a palindrome. This is checked by comparing the list `q` to its reverse (`q[::-1]`).

2. **Weight Limit**: The sum of the elements in `q` should be less than or equal to the maximum weight `w` for the object to fly.

The function returns `True` only if both conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
