CodeGeneration:
urely parse and evaluate each group**: We'll iterate through each group of parentheses, keeping track of the current nesting level, and determine the deepest level encountered.

3. **Use a stack-like approach with a counter**: For each character in a group:
   - If it is an opening parenthesis '(', increase the current depth counter.
   - If it is a closing parenthesis ')', decrease the current depth counter.
   - Update the maximum depth at each step, as it may change with each '(' encountered.

4. **Store the maximum depth**: After processing a group, append its maximum depth to the result list.

5. **Return the result list**: After all groups are processed, return the list containing the maximum depths for each group.

Implementing the above logic, we get:

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    # Split the string by spaces to get individual groups of parentheses
    groups = paren_string.split()
    # This will hold the maximum depth for each group
    max_depths = []
    
    for group in groups:
        current_depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                # Update max_depth if current_depth is greater
                if current_depth > max_depth:
                    max_depth = current_depth
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        # Append the maximum depth found in this group to the result list
        max_depths.append(max_depth)
    
    return max_depths
```

This function effectively computes the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group in the input string. Each group is processed individually, and the results are collected in a list as specified.
