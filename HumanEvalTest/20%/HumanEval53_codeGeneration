ehavior of the function.

2. **Approach**:
   - We need to perform a simple addition operation on the two input integers.
   - The function should return the result of this addition.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use the `+` operator to add the two numbers.
   - Return the result.

Here's the completed implementation of the function:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

This function correctly implements the addition operation as described in the docstring examples.
