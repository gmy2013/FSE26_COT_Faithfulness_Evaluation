2. Edge cases to consider include:
   - An empty string, which should be considered a palindrome.
   - Strings with only one character, which are inherently palindromes.
   - Strings with spaces or different cases, which we might want to ignore when checking for palindromes.

3. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Normalize the string by removing spaces and converting it to lowercase to ensure consistent comparison.
   - Compare the string to its reverse using slicing.

4. **Implement the Solution**: Now let's write the function.

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    # Normalize the string by removing spaces and converting to lowercase
    normalized_text = text.replace(' ', '').lower()
    # Check if the normalized string is equal to its reverse
    return normalized_text == normalized_text[::-1]
```

This function should correctly identify palindromes based on the given examples and edge cases.
