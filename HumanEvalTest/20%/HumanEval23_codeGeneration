CodeGeneration:
Let's continue with the thought process and complete the function implementation:

3. **Clarifications from Docstring**: 
   - The docstring provides examples of how the function should behave:
     - If the input is an empty string `''`, the output should be `0`.
     - If the input is `'abc'`, the output should be `3`.
   - This aligns with the standard behavior of calculating the length of a string.

4. **Approach**:
   - In Python, we can use the built-in `len()` function to determine the length of a string.
   - The `len()` function returns the number of characters in the string, which is precisely what we need.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The implementation of the function is straightforward. We will return the result of `len(string)`.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

This function utilizes the `len()` function to return the length of the input string, adhering to the problem requirements and the provided examples in the docstring.
