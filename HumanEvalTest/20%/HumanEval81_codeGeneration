CodeGeneration:
A against these thresholds from highest to lowest.
3. For each GPA, we'll compare it with the thresholds to find the appropriate letter grade.
4. Special cases: 4.0 is exactly 'A+', and 0.0 is 'E'.

Implementation:
We'll create a list of tuples where each tuple contains (threshold, letter_grade), ordered from highest to lowest threshold. Then for each GPA, we'll iterate through these tuples and return the first letter grade where the GPA is greater than or equal to the threshold (with special handling for 4.0 and 0.0).

Let's implement this step by step.

```python
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
    

    Example:
    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
    """
    # Define the grading scale as a list of tuples (threshold, letter_grade)
    # Ordered from highest to lowest threshold
    grade_scale = [
        (4.0, 'A+'),
        (3.7, 'A'),
        (3.3, 'A-'),
        (3.0, 'B+'),
        (2.7, 'B'),
        (2.3, 'B-'),
        (2.0, 'C+'),
        (1.7, 'C'),
        (1.3, 'C-'),
        (1.0, 'D+'),
        (0.7, 'D'),
        (0.0, 'D-')
    ]
    
    result = []
    for gpa in grades:
        if gpa == 0.0:
            result.append('E')
        elif gpa == 4.0:
            result.append('A+')
        else:
            # Find the appropriate letter grade by comparing with thresholds
            for threshold, letter in grade_scale:
                if gpa >= threshold:
                    result.append(letter)
                    break
    
    return result
```

Let's test with the provided example:
```python
print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))
