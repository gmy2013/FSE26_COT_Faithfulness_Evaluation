3. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Iterate over each element in the list `l`.
   - For each element, check if it is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`.
   - If any element is found to be greater than or equal to `t`, return `False`.
   - If we finish checking all elements and none are greater than or equal to `t`, return `True`.

4. **Implement the Solution**:

Here's the implementation of the function:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t."""
    for number in l:
        if number >= t:
            return False
    return True
```

This function iterates through each number in the list `l` and checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`. If any such number is found, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any numbers that meet that condition, it returns `True`, indicating all numbers in the list are below the threshold.
