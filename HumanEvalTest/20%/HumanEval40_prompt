    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

The following is chain of thought:
1. **Input Validation**: 
   - Check if the list `l` has fewer than 3 elements. If yes, return `False`, since it's impossible to have a triplet sum with less than three numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - Sort the list to facilitate the use of
