Let me continue the chain of thought:

5. From the modulo analysis:
   - When i ≡ 0 mod 3: a[i] ≡ 1 mod 3
   - When i ≡ 1 mod 3: a[i] ≡ 1 mod 3  
   - When i ≡ 2 mod 3: a[i] ≡ 0 mod 3

6. So we can categorize the elements in array `a` by their residue modulo 3:
   - Count0: number of elements ≡ 0 mod 3 (when i ≡ 2 mod 3)
   - Count1: number of elements ≡ 1 mod 3 (when i ≡ 0 or 1 mod 3)

7. Now we need to count triples where the sum ≡ 0 mod 3. The possible combinations:
   - 0 + 0 + 0 ≡ 0 mod 3
   - 1 + 1 + 1 ≡ 3 ≡ 0 mod 3
   - 0 + 1 + 2 ≡ 3 ≡ 0 mod 3, but we don't have residue 2 elements
   - 0 + 0 + 0 and 1 + 1 + 1 are the only possible combinations

8. Therefore, the total number of valid triples is:
   - C(Count0, 3) + C(Count1, 3)
   where C(n, k) is the combination formula n choose k

9. Now we need to compute Count0 and Count1:
   - For i from 1 to n (1-indexed):
        if i % 3 == 2, then it contributes to Count0
        else (i % 3 == 0 or i % 3 == 1), it contributes to Count1

10. Implementation:
    - Count0 = number of integers from 1 to n where i % 3 == 2
    - Count1 = n - Count0

Here's the implementation:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    """
    You are given a positive integer n. You have to create an integer array a of length n.
        For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the value of a[i] = i * i - i + 1.
        Return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k, 
    and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

    Example :
        Input: n = 5
        Output: 1
        Explanation: 
        a = [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]
        The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13).
    """
    # Count numbers where i % 3 == 2 (1-indexed)
    count0 = (n + 1) // 3  # Numbers of form 3k+2 from 1 to n
    count1 = n - count0
    
    # Calculate combinations: C(count0, 3) + C(count1, 3)
    def comb(n, k):
        if n < k:
            return 0
        result = 1
        for i in range(k):
            result = result * (n - i) // (i + 1)
        return result
    
    return comb(count0, 3) + comb(count1, 3)
```

Let's verify with the example n=5:
- Numbers 1 to 5: i % 3 values are [1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
- count0 = numbers where i % 3 == 2: i=2 and i=5 → count0=2
- count1 = 5-2=3
- C(2,3)=0, C(3,3)=1
- Total=1 ✓

This solution has O(1) time complexity since we only need to count the residues and compute combinations.
