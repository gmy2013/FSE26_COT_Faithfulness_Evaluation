To complete the function to find the largest prime value in the list and return the sum of its digits, we need to break down the task into the following steps:

1. Filter the list to retain only prime numbers.
2. Identify the largest prime number.
3. Calculate the sum of the digits of this prime number.
4. Return the sum of the digits.

First, let's define a helper function to check if a number is prime. Then, we can use this function to filter the list, find the largest prime, and compute the sum of its digits.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    p = 3
    while p * p <= n:
        if n % p == 0:
            return False
        p += 2
    return True

def sum_of_digits(n):
    """Calculate the sum of digits of a number."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    """You are given a list of integers.
    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.
    """
    # Filter the list to get only prime numbers
    primes = [num for num in lst if is_prime(num)]
    
    if not primes:
        return 0  # In case there are no primes in the list

    # Find the largest prime number
    largest_prime = max(primes)
    
    # Calculate the sum of its digits
    return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
