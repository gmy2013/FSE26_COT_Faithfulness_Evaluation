from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the Problem**: 
   - We have a list of strings and a prefix.
   - We need to return a list containing only those strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.
