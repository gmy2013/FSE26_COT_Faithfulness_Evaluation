CodeGeneration:
To implement the `string_sequence` function, follow these steps:

1. **Generate the Numbers**:
   - We need to create a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to the integer `n`. This can be achieved using Python's built-in `range` function, which generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, the specified number `n + 1`.

2. **Convert Numbers to String**:
   - Once we have the sequence of numbers, we need to convert each number to a string so that we can join them together into a single string. This can be done using `map` to apply the `str` function to each number in the sequence.

3. **Join the Strings**:
   - After converting the numbers to strings, we need to join them together with a space delimiter. This can be done using the `join` method, which takes an iterable of strings and concatenates them with the specified separator (in this case, a space).

Here's how the function can be implemented:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    # Generate numbers from 0 to n
    numbers = range(n + 1)
    # Convert each number to a string and join them with a space
    return ' '.join(map(str, numbers))
```

This function correctly generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, converts them to strings, and joins them with spaces to produce the desired output.
