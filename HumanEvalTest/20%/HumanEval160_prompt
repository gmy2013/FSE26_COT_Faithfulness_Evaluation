    """
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

The following is chain of thought:
We are given two lists: `operator` (list of strings representing operations) and `operand` (list of integers).
 The expression is built by combining the operands with the operators in the given order.
 Since the expression should be evaluated with standard operator precedence, we cannot simply evaluate left to right.
 However, note the example: operator['+', '*', '-'] and operand [2,3,4,5] becomes 2+3*4-5 which evaluates to 9 (because * has higher prec
