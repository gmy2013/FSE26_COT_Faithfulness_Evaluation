CodeGeneration:
need to determine if `n` is a prime number. If it is, we return `x`; otherwise, we return `y`.

Here is the implementation:

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is 
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    
    """
    if n < 2:
        return y
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
    return x
```

This function first checks if `n` is less than 2 (since numbers less than 2 are not prime). Then, it checks for factors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If any factor divides `n` evenly, it returns `y`. If no factors are found, it returns `x`.
