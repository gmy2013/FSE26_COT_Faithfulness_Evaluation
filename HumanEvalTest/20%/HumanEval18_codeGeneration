To implement the `how_many_times` function, we need to consider overlapping occurrences of the substring within the original string. Here's the complete implementation based on the chain of thought you provided:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """ Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string. Count overlapping cases.
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
    # Extract the length of the substring
    substring_length = len(substring)
    
    # If the substring is empty or the string is shorter than the substring, return 0
    if substring_length == 0 or len(string) < substring_length:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize a counter for occurrences
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over the string and check for occurrences
    for i in range(len(string) - substring_length + 1):
        if string[i:i + substring_length] == substring:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```
