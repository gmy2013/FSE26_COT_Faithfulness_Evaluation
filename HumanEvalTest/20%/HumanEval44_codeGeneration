CodeGeneration:
rt a number `x` from base 10 to another base `base`, we repeatedly divide the number by `base` and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty list `digits` to store the digits of the number in the new base.
   - While `x` is greater than 0:
     - Compute the remainder of `x` divided by `base` using the modulo operation (`x % base`). This remainder is the next least significant digit in the new base.
     - Prepend this remainder to the `digits` list.
     - Update `x` to the quotient of `x` divided by `base` (`x // base`).
   - If `x` is 0, we should still represent it correctly in the new base. If `digits` is empty, we can simply return '0'.
   - Join the elements of the `digits` list into a single string and return it.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x` is 0, the result should be '0' regardless of the base.
   - Ensure that the base is valid (i.e., between 2 and 9).

Here's the implementation of the `change_base` function:

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    """
    if base < 2 or base >= 10:
        raise ValueError("Base must be between 2 and 9")

    if x == 0:
        return "0"
    
    digits = []
    
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % base
        digits.append(str(remainder))
        x = x // base
    
    # Since we collected digits from least significant to most significant,
    # we need to reverse them
    return ''.join(reversed(digits))
```

This code uses a list to collect digits and then reverses the list to construct the final string representation. It handles the conversion process efficiently and checks for valid bases.
