removed from the input text. This includes both lowercase and uppercase vowels.

2. **Iterate Over Characters**: Loop through each character in the input text.

3. **Check and Filter**: If the character is not a vowel (i.e., not in the set of vowels we defined), include it in the result.

4. **Construct and Return Result**: Join all the non-vowel characters together to form the resulting string without vowels and return it.

Now, let's implement the function based on this plan:

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    >>> remove_vowels('')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm")
    'bcdf\nghjklm'
    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')
    'bcdf'
    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')
    ''
    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')
    'B'
    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')
    'zbcd'
    """
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')  # Define a set of vowels
    return ''.join(char for char in text if char not in vowels)
```

This code correctly identifies vowels and filters them out from the input text, resulting in a string that contains no vowels.
