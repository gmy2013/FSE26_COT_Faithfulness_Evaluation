ewer characters. If both lists have the same number of characters, return the first list.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Characters:** For each list, we'll calculate the sum of lengths of all strings in the list.

3. **Compare the Character Counts:** Compare the character counts of both lists.

4. **Return the Appropriate List:** Based on the comparison, return the list with fewer characters or the first list in case of a tie.

Here's the implementation of the function `total_match`:

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    # Calculate the total number of characters in lst1
    total_chars_lst1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    
    # Calculate the total number of characters in lst2
    total_chars_lst2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)
    
    # Compare the total numbers and return the appropriate list
    if total_chars_lst1 < total_chars_lst2:
        return lst1
    elif total_chars_lst2 < total_chars_lst1:
        return lst2
    else:
        return lst1  # Return lst1 if both have the same number of characters
