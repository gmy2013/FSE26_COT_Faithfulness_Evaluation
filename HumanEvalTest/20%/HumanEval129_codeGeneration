CodeGeneration:
To achieve the desired functionality, we'll use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths of length k starting from every cell in the grid. We'll keep track of the paths and compare them lexicographically to find the minimum path.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    from itertools import product

    def dfs(x, y, path, length):
        if length == k:
            paths.append(path[:])
            return
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
                path.append(grid[nx][ny])
                dfs(nx, ny, path, length + 1)
                path.pop()
    
    N = len(grid)
    paths = []
    
    for i, j in product(range(N), range(N)):
        dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]], 1)
    
    return min(paths)
