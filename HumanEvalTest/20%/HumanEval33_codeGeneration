CodeGeneration:
is divisible by three (i.e., indexes 0, 3, 6, etc.).

2. **Collect Values at Those Indexes**:
   - Extract the values from the list at these indexes.

3. **Sort the Extracted Values**:
   - Sort the list of extracted values.

4. **Place Sorted Values Back**:
   - Replace the values at the original indexes with the sorted values.

5. **Return the Modified List**:
   - Return the list with sorted elements at indexes divisible by three, leaving other elements unchanged.

Here's how you can implement this in code:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Step 1: Identify indexes divisible by three and collect their values
    values_at_div_by_three = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 3)]
    
    # Step 2: Sort these collected values
    values_at_div_by_three.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Replace original values at those indexes with sorted values
    l_sorted = l[:]  # Create a copy of the list to modify
    for i, value in zip(range(0, len(l), 3), values_at_div_by_three):
        l_sorted[i] = value

    # Step 4: Return the modified list
    return l_sorted
```

This function `sort_third` maintains the original order of elements not at indexes divisible by three, while sorting those that are. The above implementation correctly follows the steps outlined and satisfies the conditions described in the docstring.
