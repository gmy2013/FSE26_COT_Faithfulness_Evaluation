    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that

    """

The following is chain of thought:
1. **Understand the task**: The function needs to return a list that is identical to the input list `l` at odd indices, while sorting the elements at even indices.

2. **Identify even and odd indices**:
   - Even indices in a list are indices li
